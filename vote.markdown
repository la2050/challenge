### Your votes determine our winners!

**25 finalists** will be selected by Social Venture Partners Los Angeles (our evaluation partner), and the <span class="avoid-break">final award levels will be determined through public vote.</span>

All 25 finalists will be awarded a grant. Voting will determine the size of the grants finalists receive, with the top voted in each category winning the first place grant. In each goal category:
* First place winners will receive $100,000
* Second place winners will receive $50,000
* Third place winners will receive $25,000
* Fourth place winners will receive $15,000
* Fifth place winners will receive $10,000

All organizations that participate in the voting stage will receive a grant, with five grants distributed at each dollar amount (e.g., there will be five $100,000 winners, five $50,000 winners, and so on).

The winners will represent a diverse set of issues, strategies, and tactics. Winners will be selected using the following criteria:

* Impact on chosen [LA2050 goals and metrics](/about/#goals)
* Feasibility of proposal
* Impact on people served
* Overall application quality
