Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Through my company (a DBA), I produce science-based media content. My proposal
  is for an idea that is tangential to this, and I would form a nonprofit to see
  it thru if the funding and support is there. 
project_description: "In LA, parking restrictons related to street sweeping typically last from 2 to 4 hours, & violations result in tickets of $70+ dollars. Repeat & unpaid offenses lead to more costs, impounded vehicles & license suspensions. The time restriction provides a window for sweepin, but once finished, there's no reason to enforce the parking violations. We propose a campaign to change the law to lift restrictions once cleaning occurs, & an easily buildable mobile technology to inform the public when parking is once again available.\P\n"
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  In LA, parking restrictons related to street sweeping typically last 2 to 4
  hours, & violations result in tickets of $70+. Repeat & unpaid offenses lead
  to higher costs, impounded vehicles & license suspensions. 


  These burdens can drain vital funds needed to feed a family, and a means to
  get to work. It is not in the city's interest to punish anyone for only the
  letter, not the spirit, of the law.


  As well, extraneous restrictions:

  - Put more cars and frustrated drivers into traffic, looking for parking.


  - Keep people from using public transit, as they may need to move their cars
  to avoid getting a ticket.


  Both the above increase pollution and the risk of accidents.


  - Take law enforcement officers away from other duties


  - Add to the the workload in legal courts
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  I am just a citizen. I have a degree in software engineering and a career
  editing and producing media. I am an independent freelancer who has worked
  with various clients and has spearheaded projects from start to finish. I have
  been on the board of a nonprofit organization. This project would be the
  biggest thing I have ever done, and I would make it my job. To focus on
  bringing the project forward like I would any project. To keep the
  communication going. To address problems. To manage expectations, the project,
  people, and maintain quality. To balance creativity and logic to pull off both
  a campaign to change the law, and deliver a software system. Pulling this off
  requires experience with technology, government, people, and the creative
  arts... and a passion and belief that this is a way to make our city better,
  and a commitment to making it happen. That's what I bring.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  PHASE ONE - Legislation

  Update Los Angeles Municipal Code 80.69(b), which regulates street sweeping
  parking violations, to specify that for restrictions involving street
  sweeping, parking would be lawful once said street sweeping within the signage
  window has actually occurred.


  Previous to this, obtain a written policy agreement from the city that it will
  not enforce citations in said cases.


  PHASE TWO - TECHNOLOGY

  Development of a mobile based app, that could run on a tablet, laptop, mobile
  phone, or in-vehicle information system, with city personnel as its user base.
  Based on this usage, this app would then generate up to the minute publically
  available street sweeping data, which could be in turn consumed by anyone, and
  any apps. This data is available in digestable format, by humans or software,
  in real time on a city internet location.


  PHASE THREE - PUBLIC EDUCATION

  - Press releases have gone out to media organization.

  - The city has updated its websites with up to date information.

  - City social media is periodically informing the public of the new rules

  - A budget is in development for a rollout of new signage across the city.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '4000000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '10000000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  Alleviating traffic problems affects every resident and visitor to the city.
  That's at least 10 million a year.


  The idea of saving people money and frustration on parking may not at first
  seem the most deserving of financial help. There are other large scale and
  very important problems which often get more attention, deserved and worthy of
  support.


  But this problem is one that's rare: one that has a very clear and direct
  solution, with no downside. That's an opportunity to build on, to lead to
  success in other areas. An increase in municipal efficiency and resident
  satisfaction has long lasting ripple effects. A city government that's a
  partner with, not an adversary of, its citizens is a more effective city
  government.
