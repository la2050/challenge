Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  The Neighborhood Music School inspires minds and enriches our community
  through music education. We have served as a bellwether for arts equity and
  community engagement in eastern Los Angeles for 106 years.
project_description: >-
  With the support of the LA2050 Grant Challenge, the Neighborhood Music School
  Community Performance Series will provide the underserved neighborhoods of
  eastern Los Angeles with equitable access to free, high quality, public
  performances. The performances will serve as a connection point for our
  students and neighbors, resulting in increased social capital spheres and
  reinforcement of the community driven arts ecosystem of Boyle Heights. 
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  Neighborhood Music School (NMS) is responding to the need for high quality
  public performances produced and performed by community members for community
  members. NMS serves students from Boyle Heights and the communities of eastern
  Los Angeles where public art is rarely experienced. These neighborhoods are
  severely underserved and often overlooked. 

  Students are taught violin, cello, piano, drums, guitar and more by NMS
  teaching artists. The students and teachers are the core of the project as
  they are the performing musicians at the concerts. The series includes
  Concerts in the Parlor, Ensemble Performances, Recitals and Master Classes. 

  The Community Performance Series will support the social and emotional health
  of the individual as well as the community by showcasing the talents of
  community members and creating opportunities, pipelines and collaborations
  inside and outside of the Boyle Heights arts ecosystem. The project promotes a
  positive image of music and arts in eastern L.A.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  Neighborhood Music School was founded in 1914 as a Settlement House to teach
  one on one music instruction to the immigrant communities that had settled in
  Boyle Heights. 106 years later, NMS provides low cost/high quality one on one
  music instruction and mentorship to students of all ages. NMS serves as an
  artistic home and anchor in the community. 


  Although Boyle Heights is a neighborhood within the city of L.A., the median
  income can be 73% lower than more affluent areas of the city. NMS believes
  that music education is a right and not a privilege and removes the cost
  prohibitive barriers the community encounters. 


  NMS is uniquely suited to provide public performances since the students are
  highly trained and prepared to share their talents with the members of their
  own community and beyond. NMS holds deep relationships with many city and
  county offices and entities and is perfectly positioned to leverage those
  relationships to provide free public concerts. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Success will be defined in 5 key areas; performance quality, attendance,
  variety of community locations/venues, increased social capital of students
  including new partnerships and increased awareness and support of Neighborhood
  Music School’s mission and goals. 


  The quality of performance will be measured by teaching artists evaluations
  and self-evaluations by the student musicians. Rubrics and scales will measure
  increased technical and performance proficiency.


  Well attended performances will be measured by total number of audience
  members. Audience feedback surveys and interviews will provide information on
  attendee demographics and quality of experience.


  Increased social capital will be measured by additional opportunities offered
  to students and establishment of new relationships with community and audience
  members. For example, a locally owned business owner may request a performance
  in her shop, or an audience member may invite the ensemble to attend a master
  class or workshop. The number of new partnerships with NMS will also measure
  the success of the project.


  Finally, increased awareness and support of NMS’s mission and goals will be
  measured by an increase in social media followers, increase in financial
  donations, establishment of new relationships with city offices, local
  business and corporate entities and an increase in NMS student enrollment.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '375'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '4000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The broader impact of NMS Community Performance Series is to foster autonomy
  and a sense of community pride for communities in eastern L.A. These
  neighborhoods are not thought of as vibrant, creative hubs but each day
  neighbors are creating and sharing art. NMS is committed to developing Latinx
  representation in the music industry by cultivating transferable skills and
  serve as the starting point for careers in the creative economy. Similar
  neighborhoods can learn by NMS’ 106-year commitment to equity and access.
  Median income and property values aren’t the only indicators of a healthy
  community. Deep-rooted relationships, connections, and a sense of community
  pride can be instilled in all neighborhoods, regardless of socio-economic
  status.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
