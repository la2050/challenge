Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  My mission as a social action artist is to awaken the empathy of every
  individual on this planet and make the unconscious conscious and malleable.
project_description: >-
  I am looking for support to fund my interactive art exhibit, OUT OF MY HEAD.
  Through visuals, audio, and audience participation, this pioneering project
  will explain the key process for improving mental health - identifying and
  managing our thoughts. Through the duration of the exhibit, we will include
  booths that offer real tools and techniques for acquiring this skill, as well
  as workshops and speakers that will dive more deeply into the topic
  exclusively for our attendees.  
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  I am constantly stunned by the state of affairs around the world - poverty,
  gun violence, abuse, suicide, drone strikes, terrorist attacks, animal
  cruelty, bullying, and the devastating behaviors leading to the irreversible
  effects of global warming. The book, “Influencer” by Kerry Patterson,
  articulates that in order to enact REAL LASTING CHANGE we must identify the
  key behavior that transforms the outcome of high stakes situations. So I asked
  myself this question and enlarged it; Is there just one behavior that could
  change the world? My answer, yes, empathy. Empathy, the ability to understand
  or share the feelings of another. When I imagine a path toward a more peaceful
  world I see no strategy that does not undoubtedly require empathy as its
  foundation. Any organization that solicits people to care about their cause
  necessitates that people access their empathy. Politics, climate change, child
  development, pick a topic, they all fall short without empathy.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  I am an HSP (highly sensitive person). The depth of my empathy can often be
  debilitating, but it's also a superpower. I remember asking my father at a
  very young age, “why can’t everyone get along?” It pained me that there wasn't
  world peace. The need to manage and express my emotions led me to a life in
  the arts. I became a professional songwriter, actress, and designer. And yet,
  it never felt like enough. Starring on a successful children’s television
  program, writing and releasing songs, building a state-of-the-art innovation
  lab for elementary students - it never felt like I was truly solving the
  world’s problems. After a painful divorce, I was forced to start my life over.
  I endured deep suffering, depression, and a traumatizing 5150. Thankfully,
  with the help of therapists and coaches, I built the skills needed to
  understand myself and recover. Now I will use everything I have, every talent,
  passion, and skill and fuse them together to affect change. (Formal resume
  available).
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Exhibit guests will be invited to join our free empathy community network and
  mailing list. There, we will continue to provide tools and resources to track
  participants' progress. Through personal testimonials, our hope is for members
  to share how navigating and managing their thoughts is helping them reshape
  their lives and the lives of those around them. Success overall for this
  project would mean gaining enough visibility and members that we will be able
  to formalize into an official organization and produce interactive art
  exhibits and workshops all year long. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '3000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '9000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Thoughts are the most powerful subconscious force in our lives. They determine
  how we feel about ourselves, others, and the world around us. Without the
  ability to understand how our thoughts work and where they come from, we are
  powerless against whatever familial and social conditioning we inherited. The
  right thoughts increase self-esteem, improve mental health, and access
  empathy. When we want people to care about anything, from their family to
  government policy to the environment, we must understand that their behaviors
  are influenced by their thoughts. Understanding where our thoughts come from
  and acquiring the tools to manage and shape them changes the course of our
  entire lives and the fate of mankind.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
