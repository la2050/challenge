Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Center for Council delivers programs and trainings that promote communication,
  build community, enhance well-being, and foster compassion. Our mission is to
  create a world where every voice is heard, no one is invisible, and everyone
  has the opportunity to connect to community. 
project_description: >-
  “Circle Up Los Angeles” invites Angelenos to experience the care, regard and
  presence of community. Weekly in-person and virtual Councils will be hosted in
  a diverse cross-section of LA communities, providing the opportunity to gather
  and connect with myriad non-profit professionals, police officers, healthcare
  workers and system-impacted and formerly incarcerated individuals served by us
  and our partner-organizations. C-U-LA will open hearts and give voice to
  stories of all Angelenos, creating community through celebrating our shared
  journey.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - South Bay
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g, using a job
  recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing sites,
  applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college affordability to
  advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Center for Council is launching Circle Up Los Angeles (C-U-LA) to offer every
  resident in LA the opportunity to engage, interact and come together. Now more
  than ever, our communities need connection. In this time of polarizing
  elections and global health pandemics, we are faced with new societal
  challenges that threaten to widen the divide through isolation and “othering.”
  In this critical moment in time, the practice of Council has the potential to
  bring us together, fostering recognition of our shared humanity and
  interconnectedness. Council offers a replicable, self-perpetuating, portable
  platform that enables individuals to give voice to their unique stories,
  develop mutual respect and compassion for others, cultivate a positive
  response to stress, anger and hostility and achieve a sense of balance. The
  Council circle is free from the limited binaries of right and wrong, democrat
  or republican, us vs. them — it’s a birthplace for innovation and
  understanding, lifting every voice.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Center for Council has been recognized as a leader in training individuals in
  the powerful practice of Council for decades, creating transformative programs
  within the criminal and social justice, educational and health care systems.
  Connection is what we do and Council is how we do it. Council is an age-old
  practice that brings people together in a circle to bear witness and share
  authentically. Participants speak one-at-a-time, sharing their personal
  stories and experiences, rather than opinions, and listening non-judgmentally
  while others do the same. C-U-LA offers a scalable model to bring the practice
  of Council to communities throughout Los Angeles. By creating access to hosted
  public Council circles, and expanding on new virtual models, developed in
  response to the COVID-19 pandemic, this project will enable hundreds of
  Angelenos to “Circle Up,” to directly experience slowing down and listening,
  recognizing and bearing witness to our collective challenges and shared
  humanity.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Center for Council will define and measure the success of Circle Up LA by
  monitoring the quantity and quality of our impact. CU-LA will deliver 36
  in-person and 18 virtual Councils with 25 participants each directly serving
  up to 1350 people over nine-months. However, this merely demonstrates the
  first layer of impact as Council has a positive ripple effect among the
  families, businesses and communities of those touched by this project. 

  Center for Council will monitor: how many people participate in C-U-LA
  Councils; how many people take a secondary action after participating (i.e.
  hosting their own Council, participating in a training, bringing Council to
  their workplace, etc.); as well as how participants extend the intentions of
  Council (i.e. listening and speaking from the heart) into their lives.

  After attending a Council, participants will receive an email with resources
  and activities intended to both support them and monitor the impact of the
  experience. We will ask participants to think about how they are experiencing
  the light around them, the air, the noises. How are they beginning and ending
  conversations, experiencing touch? What are they hearing and seeing anew in
  others and themselves? The intention is to measure participants’ ability to be
  present with the people and world around them. Paying attention like this
  extends the intentions of Council and invites a new way of engaging that
  relies heavily on listening, observing and responding, rather than reacting.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1350'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '6750'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Compassion begins with slowing down, paying attention and caring for the inner
  life of oneself and others. Through the practice of Council, C-U-LA will
  foster compassion in individuals and groups. C-U-LA will empower individuals
  to find their voice and share their story in a circle of people who care
  enough to listen without judging. As we hear the resonance in the story of
  “the other,” and realize that we’re all in this together, community emerges.
  Independent research has demonstrated that our work transforms environments of
  anger, aggression and hostility, enables people to connect with others in new
  and meaningful ways, creates safe and supportive space for self-reflection,
  self-expression and connection without fear of judgment.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
  - 'Office space for meetings, events, or for staff'
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: ''
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
