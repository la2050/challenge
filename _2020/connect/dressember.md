Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Over 25,000 people have volunteered with Dressember using fashion and
  creativity to raise awareness and fundraise for programs fighting human
  trafficking. Our mission is to equip a community of people to advocate for the
  dignity of all people, leading to the protection and freedom of millions.
project_description: >-
  We are at a critical juncture in our history; having grown tremendously in our
  first 7 years from annually raising $165K in 2013 to raising $2.5 million in
  2019—cumulatively, this campaign has raised over $10 million to fund
  anti-trafficking work. With a peer-to-peer fundraising model, word of mouth
  has been our primary channel for awareness. We are focused on growing our
  community in LA where we are headquartered, to achieve greater impact by
  developing a comprehensive outreach strategy that extends beyond word of
  mouth.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  In today’s world of advanced technology, and seemingly progressive worldviews,
  millions are exploited through human trafficking, and 1 in 4 are children.
  Traffickers generate roughly $150 billion annually, yet many people have no
  idea that slavery exists in this form. LA is especially vulnerable to
  trafficking due to our proximity to an international border, numerous ports
  and airports, significant immigrant population, and industries that attract
  forced labor, including hospitality, agriculture, and manufacturing. Nearly
  10% of LA County’s 500,000 manufacturing jobs are in the garment industry, a
  notorious environment for forced labor. As an LA-based organization with an
  emphasis on fashion, we generate awareness of trafficking in all forms and
  additionally highlight the connection between the garment industry and forced
  labor. We use our platform as a resource to shed a light on this often
  overlooked form of trafficking and provide tools for consumers to be part of
  the solution.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  One of the roadblocks for combating trafficking is a lack of mobilization from
  the public. We have demonstrated that small, consistent actions make a
  significant and tangible impact. Our volunteer program offers an accessible
  way to engage in a dark issue—one that most people don’t feel equipped to
  fight. We do not require volunteers to obtain specific qualifications,
  instead, we encourage everyday individuals to use their voices and style
  choices to fight for freedom. Volunteering with Dressember is two-fold; it
  promotes everyday, approachable advocacy and in turn provides prevention,
  rescue, and aftercare for survivors. Our team’s year-round goal is to equip,
  educate, and provide resources to best prepare our community and create a
  legion of advocates. Through just a few clicks, volunteers set up a
  fundraising page, share their link, and engage communities to take action. We
  lead crucial active volunteerism to provide anti-trafficking organizations
  with the vital resources they need.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Dressember works with volunteers from 45+ countries, however, 5.5% of
  volunteers (~4,000 overall) are located in LA. We will measure the success of
  this project through the following metrics with visionary goals:


  1. Social Media: Increase overall engagement on Instagram (our primary
  channel) from 3% of current users in LA to 10% with the support of hiring a
  Communications Assistant. 


  2. Facebook Ads: Reach up to 4,000 Angelenos through Facebook ads with the
  help of an Advertising Consultant and subsequently implement a full-scale
  Facebook ad campaign.


  3. Community Engagement: Increase engagement and focus on advocacy building in
  LA where Dressember is headquartered. We will provide Angelenos new to
  Dressember with an innovative opportunity to volunteer and make a local,
  national, and global impact. 


  4. Increased support of LA-Based partners: Three of our partners are located
  in LA. We work with CAST (Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking) to
  offer wraparound services for survivors. With Dressember’s support, last
  quarter CAST provided services to 274 survivors of trafficking in LA— 118 were
  victims of sex trafficking, 92 were victims of labor trafficking, and 28 were
  both. We partner with Olive Crest to train staff and educate children
  transitioning out of foster care in California where the link between
  foster-care and trafficking is extremely prevalent. Additionally, Saving
  Innocence provides case management to youth survivors of sex trafficking with
  our support.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '4000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '11000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The break down of directly and indirectly beneficiaries from this project
  comes from our intention to recruit 4.5% of new volunteers (about 4,000)
  people through this project. Our average fundraiser raises $350, new
  volunteers could potentially raise an additional $1.4 million. In 2018/19, we
  raised $2 million that impacted 11,000 people. 


  Our LA partners work in case management and education/job readiness for
  survivors. It costs $3,000 to provide one survivor with case management for a
  year. $1.4 million has the ability to provide 466 survivors with case
  management. $900 provides vocational training for a teen survivor, $1.4
  million could provide over 1,500 teens with vocational training. As our
  volunteer base grows, so does our impact.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
