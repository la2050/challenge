  aand volunteer participation. Funding/support for our educational program for
  production of videos, including moderated panel discussions on pertinent
  homeless topics/concerns and about formerly homeless telling their stories
  (25%).
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - South Bay
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Greater Los Angeles is home to 59,000 men, women and children experiencing
  homelessness — 75% living without adequate shelter. Our volunteers offer hope
  and sustenance by providing survival kits to our homeless neighbors with
  essential aid to survive.  The kits provide vital aid and allow the
  opportunity for homeless to seek help as well as an empathetic connection,
  relieving the loneliness of being ignored. 

  By personally giving out the kits, volunteers learn about the empathy chasm
  between our housed and homeless neighbors. Volunteers’ perspectives are
  changed and improved through the meaningful heart-to-heart conversations they
  have with the homeless they encounter. Their worldview and perspective on
  homelessness becomes one that is filled with more compassion, empathy, and
  concern. Bridging this empathy gap, whether small or large, is crucial to
  building community support to make our housing policies and solutions to
  homelessness in Los Angeles more human-centered and inclusive.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Our outreach and educational programs are foundational to our mission to
  provide essential aid and a connection to the homeless and to educate
  volunteers and the public about the realities and myths of homelessness. Our
  work is important to us and to the LA community because our outreach and
  education programs recognize the homeless as fellow humans in need of help and
  a hand up, rather than as “others” to be ignored and forgotten.


  The Giving Spirit has 20 years of experience in reaching out to the homeless
  where they are - on the streets or in shelters. We provide a service that no
  other non-profit provides - aid and direct engagement with the homeless in our
  communities. In 20 years, we have served 55,000+ homeless friends and
  recruited 20,000+ volunteers. We succeed by providing aid efficiently -
  sourcing in-kind donations, managing volunteers, and events, coordinating
  logistics and developing a volunteer and donor base. Our accumulated expertise
  allows us to maximize our impact.  
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Success will be measured by:

  1. The number of homeless lives served

  2. The number of volunteers engaged and recruited

  3. Quality of experience for both our volunteers and homeless friends 

  (Note: Quality of experience” will be based on feedback from our volunteers
  and the homeless agencies our volunteers visit)

  4. Quality of our educational, moderated panels at outreach events

  5. Quality of our educational videos

  6. Our ability to publicize our educational videos across all channels of
  communication

  7. Success of our expansion and scaling of our operations to reach more
  homeless and volunteers at all levels.
   
  Our long term vision for success is to help people become more empathetic,
  knowledgeable and aware of the homelessness crisis in Greater Los Angeles, and
  in turn, build a stronger sense of community support for programs aimed to aid
  the homeless and ultimately end homelessness altogether.  We believe that our
  work and program to provide knowledge empathy in our volunteers and the public
  we reach will help drive policy and structural changes in society with the
  goal that one day, every single Angeleno will have a roof over his or her
  head.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '9000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '9000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  #11 states that ~9,000 people would be directly impacted by our work. ~3,000
  volunteers will serve ~6,000 homeless. ~9000 people will be indirectly
  impacted assuming that each of the 3,000 volunteers will share how their
  experience has impacted their view on homelessness with 2-4 friends. We wanted
  to show the full impact of our program and how this proposal will  enlarge the
  impact of the ~3000 volunteers who share their experiences serving ~6,000
  homeless. This shared dialogue will further bridge our empathy gap between
  housed and homeless neighbors, as well as drive a much-needed discussion
  raising awareness of housing policies and existing/failed solutions. This will
  grow support for more human-centered and inclusive policies.
