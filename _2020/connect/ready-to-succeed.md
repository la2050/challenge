Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  At Ready to Succeed (RTS), our mission is to support and empower youth
  impacted by foster care with the resources, relationships, and opportunities
  they need to launch successful careers and lead meaningful lives. 
project_description: >-
  A grant will ensure that youth aging out of foster care have a robust
  community of connection and support, particularly amidst our current health
  crisis, which makes them more vulnerable than ever. Since 2016, RTS has
  specialized in connecting these youth to the people and networks they need to
  advance in the modern workplace. As these youth now face unprecedented
  uncertainty, funding will allow us to combine forces with an aligned partner
  to provide the extra, dedicated social and emotional support that they will
  require during the next year. 
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Each year in LA, more than 1,000 youth age out of foster care, unprepared for
  adulthood and independence. Without intervention, by their mid-twenties, 30%
  will be homeless, 60% will become criminal justice system-involved, and 50%
  will be unemployed. Resilient youth continue to defy these odds. Each year, we
  enroll in our program 20-25 former foster youth "Scholars" on their way to
  becoming part of only 3% of foster youth nationally who will obtain a
  bachelor's by age 26. In college, however, they continue to lack traditional
  supports that more privileged peers receive through family. In turn, they are
  significantly more likely to drop out, saddled with debt and no degree. The
  COVID crisis creates yet another barrier for youth who are already so
  vulnerable. Now more than ever, though we are physically distant, community is
  essential. While we can't replace family, we can provide connection to
  positive individuals and networks that ensure youth are supported in this
  unprecedented time. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Our approach to career development has always centered on connection. Our
  co-founders designed RTS to leverage their own robust networks spanning a
  variety of industries including media, tech, entertainment, and social
  services, cultivated over 40+ years of combined executive experience. In
  addition to coaching foster youth in the “hidden” tools and skills for success
  that youth who grow up in stable families with financial and social resources
  often gain through role modeling, we physically connect youth to the career
  mentors, internships, job positions, and company contacts needed to open
  doors. Our partner Stepping Forward LA – which possess a uniquely 100% former
  foster youth-staff – has cultivated a strong community of 50+ adult mentors
  who provide social and emotional support to foster youth on an ongoing basis.
  In collaboration, we will leverage our complementary strengths to provide
  amplified and comprehensive support to youth over the next year when they will
  need it most. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We are proud to have grown from a small operation serving just 6 youth in
  2016, to today serving a new class of 20-25 Scholars each year. Growing at
  this steady pace has enabled us to carefully and continuously refine our
  approach to yield impressive results: To date, 100% of our seniors have
  graduated in 4.5 years from top schools including UCLA, USC, and the CSU
  system, 94% have received and completed paid internship positions during their
  time in our program, and more than 90% have secured strong first jobs within
  just six months of graduation. 


  Where RTS provides career-centered support that youth need to advance through
  college, gain work experience, build networks and connections, and secure jobs
  in high-growth industries, Stepping Forward LA provides the consistent social
  and emotional support that is equally essential to setting them up to thrive.
  Within this community, over 90% of youth consistently report building healthy
  relationships, gaining exposure to new experiences, broadening their world
  views, and gaining a lifelong social safety net in which they can receive
  support during challenging times, celebrate achievements and holidays, and
  participate productively in their communities. 


  A successful partnership through this grant will yield a minimum of 90%
  positive outcomes for all youth served in each of the following metrics cited
  above: College graduation within 4.5 years; completion of paid internships,
  employment within six months, and increase in social and emotional wellbeing.
  Even in the midst of the uncertainty and chaos produced by our current
  environment, we are committed to sustaining these positive results and
  ensuring that youth can face their futures with optimism and preparedness as a
  result of our support. 


  On a longer-term basis, this grant will help us establish a sustainable and
  effective service partnership to benefit hundreds of additional youth for
  years to come. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '90'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '300'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  This grant will be a timely investment in ensuring that the youth we serve –
  who are attempting to navigate independence at this incredibly uncertain time
  – have access to a robust network of support. By combining our expertise in
  career development with Stepping Forward LA's expertise in social wellbeing
  and community, we have a unique opportunity to integrate two successful models
  and become stronger together during this critical period. While this
  partnership will immediately benefit youth served, we believe that by
  successfully integrating resources, we will learn key lessons to guide the
  development of best practices to support Los Angeles in effectively responding
  to crises for years to come, particularly for vulnerable populations.
