Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Founded in 1995 as the official charity of the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Los
  Angeles Dodgers Foundation (LADF) is bigger than baseball, envisioning a city
  where every Angeleno, regardless of zip code, has the opportunity to thrive.
project_description: >-
  LADF will unveil three Dodgers Dreamfields at Gonzales Park, which honor
  Jackie Robinson and revive baseball and softball play in the area, as youth
  develop from T-ball to high school and college athletics. 


  This project will also include features that further benefit the local
  community, such as Fitness and Training Zones (named for Kershaw’s Challenge),
  solar elements on scoreboards, PV carports and EV charging stations in the
  parking lot, and the LADF Science of Baseball curriculum for grades 3-8, that
  uses baseball as a fun STEM textbook.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to PLAY
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Understanding cost, lack of community safety and park access, and poor quality
  fields are significant barriers to baseball/softball participation and health
  outcomes in Compton, LADF identified Gonzales Park as the site for Dodgers
  Dreamfields #55-57. The Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation
  recognizes a standard of 4 acres of parkland per 1,000 people, but
  predominately African American neighborhoods have only 1.7 acres and Latino
  communities only 0.6 acres per 1,000 people.


  Gonzales Park has become a baseball desert due to rising costs of baseball
  equipment, lack of quality coaches, and decreased local investment. With lack
  of activity at the park, gangs and community violence made it an unsafe
  environment for youth to visit, leaving 28,000 Compton youth under 18 (29% of
  total residents) with limited opportunities to play baseball/softball in their
  neighborhood. In Compton, poverty levels are significant, as 30% of families
  with children live below the poverty line.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  LADF has invested over $10 million to build and refurbish 51 Dodgers
  Dreamfields across some of Los Angeles’ most underserved communities. 


  Alongside Vision to Learn, American Heart Association and Compton Police
  Department, LADF has worked to build vibrant futures for Compton’s youth by
  providing district-wide eye screenings and a CPR skills program, which have
  impacted thousands of Compton Unified School District students. LADF uses
  sports and fields to unlock access to health and education resources.


  LADF aims to build upon its work in the community and honor Jackie Robinson’s
  legacy, through its largest Dodgers Dreamfields project to-date at Gonzales
  Park. The Dodgers Dreamfields associated with this project will support youth
  from T-ball to high school and college athletics, as Field 42 will be for
  baseball/softball players ages 5-8, Rachel Robinson Field for baseball players
  ages 9-12 and softball players ages 9-18, and Jackie Robinson Stadium for
  baseball players ages 13+. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  The goal for the Dodgers Dreamfields at Gonzales Park is to revive baseball
  and softball play in the area while providing access to safe, playable fields
  for the community.


  LADF employs a full-time Manager of Strategy & Impact to oversee its
  comprehensive evaluation system to ensure program models are using best
  practices and factoring in relevant data. Measurement tools are tailored to
  capture Dodgers Dreamfields’ goals and outcomes, and include field assessment
  surveys, pre and post program surveys, demographic data collection, focus
  groups with parents and program coaches, pre and post interviews with park
  staff, surveys from special events, meetings with community partners, and
  interviews with grantees. The data obtained provides direct insight on
  participant’s and partner’s experiences with Dodgers Dreamfields, as well as
  program success, benefits, effectiveness and opportunities for growth.


  Dodgers Dreamfields are significant, as they promote a safe park environment
  according to 95% of park directors and contribute to a positive change in the
  park’s environment according to 94.7% of park sites. Additionally, Dodgers
  Dreamfields increase overall park usage and programming as reported by 66.7%
  of parks, increase baseball participation for 81.5% of parks, and increase
  softball participation for 61.8% of parks, which validates the value Dodgers
  Dreamfields bring to the community, meeting the intended goals of the program.
  LADF anticipates similar outcomes at Gonzales Park.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '96000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Dodgers Dreamfields are game-changers because revitalized green spaces help
  revitalize communities, boosting the safety of local parks and providing a
  place where neighbors can gather, exercise and play. We construct them and
  give them back to the community to serve as resource hubs for communities to
  access resources they need to live healthier lives.


  These Dodgers Dreamfields are also part of Compton’s beautification
  initiatives, which will encourage youth to play baseball/softball and empower
  community members to gather in outdoor recreational spaces for many years to
  come.


  Roughly 28,000 youth live in Compton (29% of residents; 66.8% Latino, 30.4%
  Black/African American). More than 91% of students receive free or reduced
  school lunch.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Kershaw’s Challenge will sponsor the Fitness and Training Zones, which include
  an outdoor training area, two enclosed batting cages and bullpens, infield
  practice area, and outdoor fitness equipment to engage the community to visit
  the park.


  The City of Compton will support these Dodgers Dreamfields as part of
  Compton’s 2020 citywide beautification initiative to encourage youth to play
  baseball/softball in their neighborhood.


  The Annenberg Foundation, San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, LA84 Foundation,
  Security Benefit, The Leon Lowenstein Foundation, Office of Supervisor Mark
  Ridley-Thomas, and The Water Buffalo Club have committed funding for this
  project, bringing about a renewed energy to the sustainability and revival of
