Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Through youth development & city arts for LA, our mission is to foster
  relationships with students who face challenges that hinder progression, by
  offering structure, dedication, discipline, and motivation, leading into a
  sustainable future, promoting entrepreneurial molding & community engagement. 
project_description: >-
  We’re seeking to serve 500 underprivileged students year-round, promoting
  self-efficacy & team work through 1) cooking classes, 2) Girls Book Club
  guided through Sean Covey’s “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens”, 3)
  “Shady Lashes” entrepreneur classes, 4) HS internship program, and 5) Color
  Run & 5K Fundraiser Walk community events for 2,000 attendees. With our
  “Artisans in Motion” mobile arts stage, we give our kids an opportunity to
  penetrate the workforce, express themselves creatively, and engage with
  various communities throughout LA. 
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
  - Long Beach Unified School District
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Our programs are designed for students seeking to develop self-efficacy and
  trade skills, and engage with various L.A. demographics. Experts state that
  children exposed to poverty and single-parent homes are most often surrounded
  by violence/drugs and more likely to face increased risk of academic failure,
  gang involvement, teenage pregnancy, or be susceptible to symptoms of
  depression, anxiety, and PTSD, heightening the risks of suicidal ideation or
  committing a crime risking exposure to juvenile courts. The mission of Refresh
  Youth Center is committed to minimizing unfortunate events and advancing
  social and economic equity in under-resourced communities as we are focused on
  underprivileged youth and minority demographics. Through RYC, we cohesively
  mesh arts, education, career development, and mentorship to support and offer
  resources to at-risk youth. Our programs are effective because we establish
  platforms that allow our staff to relate to versatile youth and communities. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Founder La Ronda Smith is a Certified Life Coach sitting on multiple school
  boards, with a BS in Human Services (concentration in Children and Family
  Services). RYC’s Executive Director possesses 10+ years of community outreach
  and non-profit development (working with HeadStart and LAUSD) and obtaining a
  BS, MBA, and Masters in International Business. Refresh Youth Center “prepares
  young minds for a better future” by promoting collaboration and enhancing
  social programs while paving the way for underprivileged youth to overcome
  personal tragedies and gain real-life skills that can be used through their
  young adulthood transitioning. Comprised of diverse individuals across a
  variety of ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds, our team are positioned to
  make a dynamic and lasting impact within our L.A. communities through our
  programs. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Through our programming we seek to achieve the following results:

  •See an improvement in grades and group participation. The majority of the
  youth that enroll in our programs are dealing with neglect, suffering from
  abandonment, peer pressure (sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, gang
  exposure, and bullying), single-parent homes being maintained by grandparents
  (65 years of age or older), lack of support and participation from family
  members, exposure to juvenile courts, frequent truancy and expulsion from
  school, poverty/homelessness/hunger, and poor communication and acting in
  aggression towards others.

  • Based on surveys distributed to students, parents, teachers and
  administrators we want our students exiting our program to traverse into high
  school to have gained “essential life skills, an helpful ear to express
  themselves, self- confidence and self-efficacy, and feelings of safety and
  belongingness”.

  • We obtain tangible results and find an increase in group sharing, leadership
  skills, self-accountability, and team support. 

  • Los Angeles community members wanting to attend our special events which
  promote ‘Life, Love, Hope, Beauty, Strength, Diversification and Unification’
  through “Artisans in Motion”. 


  Though our productions are catered towards families and groups of all ages and
  backgrounds, our focus is inspiring our underprivileged youth to believe in
  something greater than them. The predominant racial or ethnic distribution in
  the public schools is as follows: Hispanic-Latino 56%; White 21%;
  African-American 12% and Asian 11%. Although English is the predominant
  language, Spanish and other languages are increasing, with 61 percent (61%) of
  the population being non-English speaking, encouraging “Artisans in Motion” to
  incorporate versatile languages into our pop-up experiences. Approximately 34
  percent (34%) of the children in Los Angeles are poor, live in female-headed
  households and/or are Hispanic. Los Angeles County has been surveyed and found
  to have the highest density of poverty in the State of California. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '800'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '2300'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Through our year-round programs we will offer developmental workshops to 800
  youth, who will then participate in our special events, exhibiting their
  self-efficacy, team work, entrepreneurial, and STEAM capabilities as they host
  and engage with various community members throughout Los Angeles. 


  The end goal is for Artisans in Motion to promote collaboration and collective
  impact by strengthening the bonds of Los Angeles entities (such as educational
  institutions, recreation centers, special public community events) and enhance
  art and social programs through unique pop-up experiences to meet the needs of
  at-risk youth and communities (or those not often exposed to artistic cultural
  experiences), creating a deep sense of community. 
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
