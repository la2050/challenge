Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Los Angeles Audubon works to promote the enjoyment and protection of birds and
  other wildlife through outdoor education programs, bird-friendly activities,
  and hands-on conservation initiatives.
project_description: >-
  Urban Nature Network will grow the next generation of environmental stewards
  by providing a pathway for higher learning opportunities, internships, and
  career development. A single student has access to a support structure that
  could serve them from third grade on through their first few years as a recent
  college graduate, providing them with opportunities to gain valuable
  experience in E-STEAM fields and hands-on experience in environmental
  research, habitat restoration, conservation and community action.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - >-
    LAUSD (please select only if you have a district-wide partnership or
    project)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  Many youth in the urban core have little access to nature. The program aims to
  empower youth from elementary school through their early professional years to
  become stewards of their community via hands-on environmental education and to
  have a voice in their environmental future. Science-based nature education
  takes place at schoolyard habitats, parks, and beaches where students study
  nature up-close. Network alumni in their college years are highly effective
  docents in our elementary and middle school field trip programs and also help
  mentor high school students entering our paid internship program. The Nature
  Network serves a diverse group including children and adults with
  developmental, learning, and emotional disabilities through our connection
  with the Exceptional Children’s Foundation (ECF). 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Nature demands action! We must provide today's youth with the knowledge and
  leadership skills necessary to meet the environmental challenges that lie
  ahead. The program serves more than 5,000 urban students each year at
  schoolyard habitats, after-school outdoor learning labs, and science-based
  field trips. We are uniquely positioned to reach urban youth through our
  long-standing relationships with LA County schools, parks and beaches. The
  majority of students we serve come from economically disadvantaged families.


  By offering under-served youth early access to nature education and paid
  internships that provide hands-on experience in environmental research,
  habitat restoration, conservation and community action, we will be able to
  further our mission by inspiring and empowering the next generation of
  environmental stewards to pursue higher education and career goals that they
  may not have known existed.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  The Nature Network program will: 


  Engage approximately 5,000 students in grades 3 to college in environmental
  education activities. We scaffold programs to provide increasing opportunities
  for greater involvement in nature as students get older. For example, a single
  student could participate in all of our nature education programs - beginning
  with a third-grade field trip to Ballona Wetlands, a middle school session at
  Kenneth Hahn Park, then as a high school intern at Baldwin Hills, and upon
  graduation become a community leader and paid LA Audubon intern.


  Provide bus transportation for under-resourced schools to participate in
  educational field trips to Ballona Wetlands, parks and beaches.


  Empower high-school students via after-school paid internships that will
  include mentoring elementary students at parks and schoolyard habitats where
  intergenerational learning leads to life-long stewardship awareness.


  Support high school students with college-prep workshops (many are
  first-generation college applicants.) Over the past decade, we’ve helped
  students who’ve received acceptance letters from 71 different colleges,
  including Amherst, Brown, Cornell, UC Berkeley, Santa Monica, West LA, CSLB. 


  Offer the possibility of full-time employment opportunities for college
  graduates who’ve come through our program and have returned to give back to
  their LA community.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '5000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  Los Angeles Audubon believes that engaging under-represented urban communities
  are a key component to achieving long-term conservation success. Creating a
  workforce in the fields of natural resource management, environmental science,
  urban planning, and environmental education that reflects a true diversity of
  communities will be key to keeping these fields relevant, innovative, and
  effective. Students participate in public land management meetings (Baldwin
  Hills Conservancy), assist CA Parks with volunteer training, and alumni and
  young staff members attend nature advocacy day in Sacramento. 

  We also engage 1,000 community members in habitat restoration events at parks
  and beaches and aim to inspire widespread environmental stewardship.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
  - 'Office space for meetings, events, or for staff'
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: ''
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Enrollment in afterschool programs
  - College matriculation
  - Opportunity youth (“Disengaged youth” 16-24 not working or in school)
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?:
  - LA is the best place to PLAY
  - LA is the healthiest place to LIVE
