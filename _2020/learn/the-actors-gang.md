  A vital segment of TAG Education Department in-school programming is offered
  in continuation high schools where TAG attempts to disrupt the school to
  prison pipeline with its workshops and serve as a form of creative prevention
  for students who do not respond to traditional learning methods. TAG seeks
  funding for continued programming and a study on the impact of its workshops
  at Boyle Heights Continuation High School. A positive outcome with this group
  will prove the value of art programming in this high risk population.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:

  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  TAG-ED has been delivering integrated arts education workshops for more than
  10 years. A vital segment of TAG-ED in-school programming is offered in
  continuation high schools where TAG attempts to disrupt the school to prison
  pipeline and serve as a form of creative prevention for students who do not
  respond to traditional learning methods. TAG-ED engages with students who live
  in under-resourced and historically marginalized communities. Many of the
  children we work with live in out-of-home care or experience unstable home
  lives; they experience economic, social, and personal hardships. Some are in
  foster homes, have been incarcerated, or have dropped out of school, and,
  therefore, are marginalized in the system. TAG-ED offers a way to express
  feelings in a productive, positive and creative manner, in a safe space where
  students won't be judged. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Our mission statement includes the objective to “introduce theater to
  children, helping them find their creative voices.” TAG-ED’s goal isn’t to
  create young actors, but rather to engage young people in a way that allows
  them to see themselves as an integral part of the world and the people in it,
  not separate from it. TAG is uniquely qualified to deliver programming to this
  population; Teaching Artists (TAs) are required to continually train in our
  unique “Style” as part of TAG’s Theater Company. TAG provides two mandatory,
  in-house trainings for all TAs to ensure they understand the unique issues and
  challenges which are encountered when working with a variety of populations.
  In addition to proficiency in the “Style”, cultural awareness and sensitivity
  training is required and imperative to the successful outcomes for this
  population. A fundamental principle at TAG is everyone should have access to
  the arts regardless of income or circumstances.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Classroom teachers consistently report a growth in empathy among students who
  have participated in TAG-ED programming. They also tell us that TAG-ED
  students are more apt to participate, receive better test scores and get along
  better with other students after participating in our programs. School
  administrators tell us that TAGs presence has a positive impact on the entire
  culture of their schools. Parents and guardians tell us that their children’s
  behavior at home improves after participating in our programming. 

  The value of integrated arts education programs is well known; however, we are
  not aware of any studies that specifically studies the continuation high
  school population which, of course, are the most at-risk. A positive outcome
  with this group will prove the value of art programming in this population.
  Our vision of success includes additional programming and resources made
  available to these students through TAG-ED as well as other arts education
  programs. Empirical data to support our assertion that integrated arts
  education programming in this population improves attendance, graduation
  rates, pro-social behavior and social emotional learning is vital to acquire
  additional resources.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '75'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '2430'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: "In LAUSD there are 41 continuation high schools with an enrollment of 2,430 students. TAG-ED currently has the resources to offer programming in two of those schools. Having PROOF of the positive impact of programming will theoretically change the way resources and programs are delivered to this population impacting the students, their families and the community.\n\n“Overall school culture has improved; students who do not relate positively or have had positive relationships in school have been able to cultivate an improved school experience while participating in the workshops.” \n-\tWanda Helton Robinson, Principal, Whitney Young Continuation High School\n"
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.:
  - Los Angeles Unified School District - Arts Education Branch
  - WestEd
  - Boyle Heights Continuation High School
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Arts education
  - High school graduation rates
  - Suspension and expulsion rates
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?:
  - LA is the best place to CREATE
