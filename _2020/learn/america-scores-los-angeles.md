Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  The mission of America SCORES LA (ASLA) is to inspire Los Angeles (LA) youth
  to lead healthy lives, be engaged students, and have the confidence and
  character to make a difference in the world. America SCORES LA empowers youth
  to create positive change in their communities and the world overall.
project_description: >-
  The Literacy in Action program addresses the prevalence of low literacy and
  rising obesity rates that disproportionately affect youth in low-income
  communities. A unique combination of soccer, poetry, and service-learning,
  students receive more than 100 hours of structured physical activity and
  English Language Arts (ELA) support with an emphasis on player participation,
  team engagement, and developing healthy lifestyle choices. We want to instill
  a genuine passion for playing soccer and establish a lifelong dedication to
  physical activity.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Westside
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  LA county is experiencing an epidemic of illiteracy and obesity that
  disproportionately affects Hispanic/Latino youth, females of color, and those
  living at or below poverty LA county’s literacy rate is less than half the
  national average (33.5% versus 79%), and of English Language Learners only 32%
  are considered proficient in English Language Arts (ELA) compared to 59% of
  the overall LA school population. In 2018, 51.8% of Hispanic/Latino 5th
  graders in LA County were overweight or obese. ASLA works exclusively at Title
  1 schools lacking sports and creative art programs. Over 3/4 of participants
  are children of color, 90% are Hispanic/Latino, half are female, and 85% live
  at or below the poverty line. At ASLA schools, only 25% of students meet the
  state physical fitness requirements. Students receive 100+ hours of structured
  physical activity and ELA supporting active and healthy lifestyles.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  ASLA works exclusively at Title 1 schools that have largely eliminated sports
  and creative arts programs to focus on academics creating a void in the
  social, emotional, and physical development of at-risk students. Serving up to
  450 students, ASLA works with students from low-income families, who have
  increased risk of academic failure and obesity. There are no other
  after-school programs offering a combination of soccer, poetry &
  service-learning for low-income neighborhoods in LA. The innovative approach
  improved health, academic achievement, and civic engagement, resulting in
  continued engagement of student alumni contributing 12,000+ hours of volunteer
  service back to the organization.ASLA participants significantly improve in
  multiple domains:89% improve aerobic ability;73% reach the “health fitness
  zone”for age group;75% improve grammar and writing mechanics;98% graduate high
  school;90% are more resilient;98% are more confident,&3x more likely than
  peers to reach ELA standards.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We strive for ASLA students to further cultivate teamwork, literacy, and
  leadership skills enabling disadvantaged youth to excel in both school and
  life. Our long term goal will be achieved using our holistic approach to
  prepare students to graduate, matriculate to college, and join the workforce
  contributing to their communities. ASLA programs are evaluated both internally
  and externally. External evaluations are performed by: Educational Research
  Consultants, Research Support Services, Beyond the Bell, and the America
  SCORES National Office. ASLA invested in new data collection/evaluation
  partnering with UpMetrics and Hello Insight to capture student attendance and
  educational performance data in standardized tests and social emotional
  learning. ASLA internal evaluations elicit principal, parent, teacher, coach,
  alumni and student feedback. ASLA measures success in student engagement and
  attendance, hours of physical activity, fitness test results, academic
  performance, and behavior. Long term evaluations focus on graduation rates,
  service hours, leadership, and athletic distinction. ASLA will participate in
  150+ hours of physical activity, demonstrate increased attendance rates,
  improved academic performance, and graduate! 75% of students will improve
  their grammar and writing mechanics. 85% of students will improve
  cardiovascular capacity and aerobic fitness. Students will be 90% more
  resilient, 98% are more confident, and 3x more likely than peers to reach ELA
  standards.
