Please describe the mission of your organization.: Think Together partners with schools to change the odds for kids.
project_description: >-
  With support from LA2050, Think Together will transition 50 former Youth
  Policy Institute sites to Think Together programming. These include: robust
  literacy and math programs for K-8; tutoring and credit recovery classes for
  grades 9-12; social emotional learning and trauma-informed care programs,
  college and career readiness programs; and workforce readiness (WREP)
  programs, career workshops and internships.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  In October, Think Together leadership engineered the rescue of nearly half of
  Youth Policy Institute (YPI), a high-profile LA educational nonprofit that
  experienced a fiscal meltdown nearly overnight. YPI had pursued a wide variety
  of grants including place-based programs for underserved students but were
  unable to manage them fiscally. This was exacerbated by the CEO’s
  malfeasance. 


  These crucial programs were at risk of being taken back by state and federal
  agencies or being discontinued, so we created a “pop up” job fair in downtown
  LA, hired more than 450 former YPI staff in one weekend, and then seamlessly
  continued program for 10,000 K-12 students at 47 schools the following
  Monday. 


  While our expertise and trusted relationships with district administrators are
  helping facilitate the transition, the merger has brought challenges in both
  infrastructure and curriculum. YPI’s programs were in disarray, students were
  not getting high-quality programs, and staff morale was low.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  For more than twenty years, Think Together has served hundreds of thousands of
  students in California communities that have traditionally been excluded and
  under-resourced. Our robust menu of high-quality programs supports the whole
  child with educational, social-emotional, health and wellness learning,
  providing students with the opportunity to develop the tools they need to
  succeed in school and in life.


  These programs include career-defining STEM instruction and projects in coding
  and robotics for all ages, and workforce readiness (WREP) for older students.
  We leverage our committed partnerships with schools and districts across the
  state to guarantee best practices and align our programs with school day
  instruction, maximizing impact in the classroom. In addition to applying their
  skills, talents and abilities to build into the lives of students, many of our
  onsite staff have college degrees, and operate as valued defacto faculty
  members and caring adult role models.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  The transition of all former Youth Policy Institute sites from YPI’s basic
  level of after school supervision to Think Together’s robust programming is
  already underway, and generous support from LA 2050 will accelerate the
  process. Need is great at these schools. The number of students qualifying for
  Free or Reduced-Price Meals at these 47 campuses ranges from 75 percent to 100
  percent.


  The eventual success of this conversion period will be defined as having the
  following educational elements fully in place: robust literacy and math
  programs for K-8 students; tutoring and credit recovery classes for grades
  9-12; social emotional learning and trauma-informed care programs, college and
  career readiness programs; and workforce readiness (WREP) programs, career
  workshops and internships.


  Think’s core program operates every day after school from school dismissal
  until 6pm for 36 weeks for 20 hours per week (720 total hours). The schedule
  of specific units of study depends on grade level. 


  Based on our history of success in helping students develop their academic,
  social and technical skills, we expect that: 1) elementary school students
  will demonstrate improvement in English and Math; 2) participants in coding
  programs will demonstrate knowledge of STEM concepts; and 3) high school
  students will graduate college and career ready.


  In addition, we will soon complete the successful integration of all YPI back
  office functions to Think’s online management, accounting and Human Resources
  systems.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '10000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: ''
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Our broader impact will be through wraparound supports for the 10,000 students
  at these 47 LA schools. YPI had ambitious, place-based programs that were
  ultimately not sustainable in the long term. We will create a system of
  public/private partnerships with layers of collaborative efforts designed to
  sustain a robust K-12 continuum of programs leading to college and career
  opportunities for each of our kids.


  Our measurables align closely with each LA 2050 LEARN goal in early care and
  education programs, student proficiency and graduation rates, community
  college enrollment and youth employment opportunity.


  Our efforts to make LA the best place to LEARN will also help make it the best
  place to create, plan, connect and live.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
  - 'Office space for meetings, events, or for staff'
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: ''
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - High school graduation rates
  - Student proficiency in English & Language Arts
  - Proficiency in STEM
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?:
  - LA is the best place to PLAY
