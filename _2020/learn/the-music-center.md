  We connect the people of LA with one another and with art that can enrich
  their lives.

  Recognizing the arts are crucial in the development of every child, The Music
  Center’s VSAF engages 7,000+ students with disabilities, family and community
  members from across LA County through in-school arts learning, inclusive arts
  integration classroom support, and a five-day professional development series
  for educators, culminating in a two-day public festival at The Music Center
  Plaza. The festival features student performances and artwork, workshops, as
  well as panels and performances by community partners and artists with
  disabilities.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    LAUSD (please select only if you have a district-wide partnership or
    project)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  In California, only 26% of all students statewide receive access to the arts
  (CA Dept of Education). And in LA, we face issues of cultural equity,
  inclusion, and accessibility (LA County Arts Report: Cultural Equity and
  Inclusion Initiative).  


  Further, students with disabilities do not receive the same opportunities to
  pursue arts engagement compared to non-disabled peers, let alone the
  opportunities to celebrate artistic achievement. Those that do participate in
  the arts often receive instruction of lesser quality because many teachers are
  not trained in working with students with disabilities (Vanderbilt
  University’s Kennedy Center for Human Development). 


  To address this gap, The Music Center equips teachers with best practices and
  produces inclusive opportunities for students of all abilities to learn and
  perform, providing them with outlets for communication and classroom
  inclusivity. By also involving the community, we foster dialogue and promote
  understanding and compassion.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  More than LA’s performing arts capital, The Music Center is LA’s largest arts
  education provider, engaging over 150,000 children and teachers annually, many
  of whom reside in the County’s underserved communities. Our reach speaks to
  the quality of our programs, which have benefited from 40+ years of best
  practices, including robust teaching artist training. Further, our commitment
  to inclusivity is embodied through the newly renovated and accessible Plaza,
  home to VSAF, along with our new vision to serve all Angelenos. Josephine
  Ramirez, a community arts advocate formerly with the Irvine Foundation,
  oversees our education programs and ensures we remain in the vanguard of arts
  innovation. By leveraging resources, best practices, space, and social
  capital, including our connections to world class performers, LAUSD and LA
  County Office of Education, The Music Center is poised to support and
  celebrate the 3,500 youth with disabilities and 3,500 members of the public at
  VSAF.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We envision a festive, inclusive gathering with school partners and local
  communities. Indicators of success include:  


  Pre-Festival:

  • Teachers are equipped with arts learning strategies and curriculum packets
  that support students with disabilities 


  • Students complete in-school arts curriculum leading up to VSAF; they learn
  and rehearse their performances; create artwork for student exhibition 


  Day 1:

  • Student fulfillment as noted by expressions of joy, energy, completion of
  their performances and positive response from audiences 


  • Student engagement through arts workshops and live performances 


  • Student artwork is displayed and seen by all attendees 


  Day 2:

  • Families and community members fill the plaza and participate  


  • Community ADA organizations host workshops, live performances, public panels
  and information booths 


  • Visitors gain improved understanding of people with disabilities 


  Data collecting consists of interviews with schools and participants, focusing
  on anecdotal evidence that sheds light on student and teacher experience. We
  also conduct surveys with attendees to measure experience and to gauge their
  understanding of the disability community. 


  Music Center staff meets with teachers and school administrators to gauge
  impact of the teaching artist residencies, beginning with planning meetings
  through post-residency. We assess student and teacher experience, as well as
  areas of success and improvement.  


  Lastly, we rely on LAUSD and LACOE input to evaluate our programs and to
  conduct outreach.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '3500'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '3500'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Arts learning and creation helps students with disabilities develop
  self-efficacy and self-expression, and when done in an inclusive setting like
  at VSAF, fosters their sense of community and social skills. Further, by
  supporting educators, VSAF integrates inclusive arts learning into classrooms
  and provides teachers more than curriculum and best practices—they develop a
  foundation for carrying out learning beyond the framework of the festival.
  Ultimately, by seeking common ground through the arts, VSAF mitigates the
  greatest barriers that people with disabilities encounter – that is, barriers
  enforced by those who do not understand their needs – bridging differences and
  creating a culture of empathy and understanding.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Communications support
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: >-
  The Music Center has two primary partners for its Very Special Arts Festival
  (VSAF): Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and Los Angeles County
  Office of Education (LACOE). There are also 80 participating schools, a
  different set each year, from multiple districts throughout Los Angeles
  County.
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Arts education
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?:
  - LA is the best place to CREATE
  - LA is the best place to PLAY
  - LA is the best place to CONNECT
