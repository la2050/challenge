Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  TYS’ mission is to use the richness of Shakespeare’s works to create early,
  challenging, and formative learning experiences in LA’s Title 1 elementary and
  middle schools, and to promote exposure and high expectations regardless of
  students’ ethnicity, origin, or income level.
project_description: >-
  TYS’ after-school program emboldens our students by elevating their academic
  and life skills, inspiring them to go beyond what they thought possible. Our
  12-week programs culminate in high-quality theatrical productions of
  Shakespearean plays which they perform in the original Elizabethan text for
  their school and community.   Your support will enable us to serve more
  schools and deliver full Performing Arts and Production Design components in
  each of them, greatly impacting our number of participating students and reach
  to school communities. 
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  “The streets are waiting for our kids.”   

  We hear this way too often from too many parents in our service community.  We
  select schools in Los Angeles neighborhoods that are disproportionately
  impacted by poverty, homelessness, and gang violence.   


  TYS begins in 4th grade providing early and formative intervention; we seize
  the opportunity to raise our students’ awareness of their innate talents,
  challenge their academic and social skills, and provide a positive peer
  community.  They discover innumerable ways to apply their skills and energy
  and expand their self-expectation and sense of possibility. 


  TYS successfully instills critical life skills – resiliency, discipline,
  teamwork, respect for self, and others. Our partner school communities
  repeatedly confirm that TYS makes a vast difference by teaching our students
  about themselves and the world around them, and how to navigate their way
  within it powerfully.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  We achieve our goals.  We built a curriculum that really works; builds strong,
  trusted partnerships with our schools; has trained passionate teaching
  artists; and continually expands our reach and program offerings.  


  We empower our students.  At the request of “alumni” from different schools,
  we supported their approach to their school principal, enlisted the help of
  their magnet coordinator, and added John Adams Middle School downtown to our
  roster.  We are creating paths to grow with our students through high school
  and beyond.


  We pursue support. We enjoy funding by committed donors, foundations and
  public agencies (including California Community Foundation, California Arts
  Council, Neighborhood Councils).  We have pro-bono relationships with critical
  vendors.  We are creating strategic relationships with LA’s leading arts
  organizations, pursue the support of local politicians, and continue to
  develop dedicated volunteers.  We honor our donors and make every dollar
  count.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "TYS is a proven success in using the broad platform of the theatrical arts to attract and hold attention, develop and utilize academic and life skills, cultivate and apply critical thinking independently and collaboratively, and provide a truly transformative experience for all involved.   Our goal is to expand our reach – more schools, more students, more programming.\n\nWe measure our success via both anecdotal and data-driven methods. We track and enjoy high attendance, re-enrollment from year to year, and subsequent enrollment of siblings, cousins, and friends.  We conduct written surveys (Student self-assessment; Classroom/Liaison Teacher assessment of each student) at the beginning and end of each program, as well as our Principals’ assessments of overall school impact and written surveys of our Teaching Artists at the end of each program.  Our executive team reviews all information to remain current regarding the effectiveness of our curriculum and delivery, and we implement adjustments if/as needed.\n\nThe comments we regularly hear are equally important indicators of our success: \n•\t2nd and 3rd graders press to know when they can become Young Shakespeareans;\n•\tOur Alumni regularly return to share their latest achievements;\n•\tTeachers report that their TYS students’ classroom participation and confidence notably increase;\n•\tPrincipals report that parents push for months for the program to begin;\n•\tParents report that their previously shy children become more outgoing and willing to try new things;\n•\tLocal residents tearfully thank us for bringing pride to their neighborhood;\n•\tAffluent audience members are surprised, impressed, and inspired by our students’ poise, and reconsider the possibilities that exist in the neighborhoods we serve.\n\n"
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '344'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '6273'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >+
  TYS demands a commitment to step way beyond one’s comfort zone, thus
  cultivating a sense of empowerment and agency rarely delivered by after-school
  arts programs.

   “School” becomes a vibrant center for its students, parents, and surrounding residents; in fact, TYS is cited as a factor in improved attendance, and designations of California “Blue Ribbon School” Awards. 

  To continue engagement upon LAUSD’s COVID-19 closure, we rapidly launched a
  Virtual Program which is enjoying 99% attendance.  We’ll record/edit all final
  performances, turning difficult circumstances into a wonderful opportunity
  where, together with our students, we can rightfully proclaim “IF I CAN DO
  SHAKESPEARE, I CAN DO ANYTHING!!!”
