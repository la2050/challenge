Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  We are a new material technology company that turns food waste into
  sustainable fibers that can apply to apparel, bed linen, and packaging.
project_description: >-
  We would like to have support in marketing, branding, building partnership and
  distribution channels, and PR. 
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g, using a job
  recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing sites,
  applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college affordability to
  advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Food waste creates 3.3 billion tons of greenhouse gases. 128 million tons of
  milk are thrown away every year globally. The world doesn't need another food
  delivery service, it needs a solution to solve food waste. 

  Currently, there are two types of fibers in the world: petroleum-based (ex.
  polyester) and plant-based (ex. cotton, bamboo, modal, etc.). We are creating
  a third type of fiber, which is made from food waste. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Fashion is the second most polluting industry in the world. In order to save
  the fashion industry issue, we have to target the root problems, which are the
  big fashion/apparel brands. We are the perfect team to deliver the result.
  Robert is a three-time entrepreneur. He sold his first company for $300,000
  while he studied at the University of Southern California. He is a Forbes
  Under 30 Scholar and Global Shaker's Sustainable Fashion Innovator 2019. He is
  also an Entrepreneur Hall of Fame at the University of Southern California
  Marshall School of Business. We have a team of Ph.D. material scientists and
  chemists. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  There are two trajectories for Mi Terro. First, we will develop a variety of
  fibers from different types of protein-based food waste, not just milk waste.
  Second, we will continue to experiment with milk polymer; we already know that
  milk can be made into packaging film, bed sheets, medical appliances, and
  tissue.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '4000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '100000000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  We can reduce LA's food waste problem, the fashion pollution problem, and the
  plastic problem. We would like to collaborate with supermarkets to recycle and
  reuse their milk waste into fibers for apparel factories. 

  We would replace plastic packaging with milk waste packaging.

  Our process uses 60% less water than cotton. 
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
