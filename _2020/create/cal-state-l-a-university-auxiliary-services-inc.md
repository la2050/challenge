Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Our mission is to create innovative, category-defining life science startups
  within the vibrant and supportive environment of Cal State LA. LA BioSpace
  provides diverse biomedical entrepreneurs the programming and capacity to turn
  scientific advances into job-creating businesses in Los Angeles.
project_description: >-
  LA BioSpace, a Cal State LA initiative, provides entrepreneurs with
  state-of-the-art facilities and resources to launch startups and spur regional
  economic development. LA BioStart, a signature program of LA BioSpace, has
  trained and mentored more than 100 culturally diverse bioentrepreneurs over
  the last 3 years. LA BioSpace is looking to create a dedicated workspace for
  LA BioStart, including 2 state-of-the-art conferencing facilities, maximizing
  the cross-pollination of ideas and allows LA BioStart to reach
  bioentrepreneurs across LA County.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  LA BioSpace is located at Cal State LA on the east side of Los Angeles and
  serves culturally diverse bioentrepreneurs who typically lack access to the
  resources and networks of biotech centers like Boston and San Francisco. Of
  the more than 27,000 students attending the university, about two-thirds are
  Latinx and 60% are the first in their families to attend college. LA BioSpace
  will provide these students and the broader community the necessary space,
  technology, and network of scientific and business experts to be competitive
  with these other biotech hubs.


  Bioentrepreneurship needs to be democratized and accessible to the culturally
  and economically diverse people of Los Angeles County. For the 2021 cohort, LA
  BioStart will address this need with focused training and mentoring of
  approximately 20 entrepreneurs. The LA 2050 award would provide LA BioSpace
  the necessary resources to help scale LA BioStart and make it accessible
  across LA County. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Cal State LA was selected by the Coalition of Urban & Metropolitan
  Universities to uplift the economies of communities across the nation. We are
  committed to fostering a thriving and progressive region through meaningful
  community partnerships and initiatives. LA BioSpace encourages inclusive
  entrepreneurial programs that impact Cal State LA and our broader community of
  minority and female entrepreneurs. This commitment is further evidenced by the
  high diversity represented within LA BioStart’s previous 5 cohorts of
  entrepreneurs.    


  LA BioSpace wants to extend inclusive entrepreneurship to reach scientists and
  entrepreneurs throughout LA County. We know how to build life science
  companies and communicate this to the Fellows within the LA BioStart program.
  This project enables LA BioSpace and LA BioStart to increase their ability to
  communicate and collaborate with a much larger group of entrepreneurs,
  creating more high-growth startups and economic development within LA County.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "Goals for the project:\n1.\tGoal 1 – develop two conferencing centers within LA BioSpace to facilitate communication and collaboration with our partners in LA County and other biotech hubs, worldwide\n2.\tGoal 2 – support LA BioStart’s goal of increasing inclusive innovation within LA County \n\nMeasuring success for Goal 1:\n•\tCentralization of LA BioStart – 90% of LA BioStart activities such as business creation, financing, and intellectual property development will be conducted at LA BioSpace \n•\tImproved collaboration – improvement in collaboration across geographically distributed partners is measured by 1) surveying collaborators and 2) measuring communication (e.g., emails, Zoom meetings) across regions  \n\nMeasuring success for Goal 2:\n•\tLA BioStart participation – the next cohort will include approximately 20 bioentrepreneurs, with approximately 2000 participating, virtually\n•\tCompany creation – approximately 10 newly incorporated high-growth startups will join the next cohort, with another 40 LA County-based companies participating, virtually \n•\tJobs – an estimated 100 new jobs will be created by LA BioStart companies (within 12-24 months post-program participation)\n•\tIntellectual property – approximately 20 new patent provisional applications will be filed by LA BioStart companies (within 12 months post-program participation)\n•\tVenture capital & grant funding – an estimated $10MM of venture capital financing and grants will be raised by LA BioStart companies (within 12 -24 months post-program participation)\n"
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '20'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '2000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  LA BioSpace wants to democratize access to training and mentorship for
  bioentrepreneurship for the culturally and economically diverse County of Los
  Angeles. In so doing, we support more entrepreneurs that create high-growth
  startups that lead to increased venture capital investment, intellectually
  property, and high-paying jobs for the region. 

  The development of state-of-the-art conferencing centers within LA BioSpace
  provides a mechanism to bring the much-needed life science technical and
  business expertise to the East Los Angeles region, virtually. Experts from the
  major world biotech hubs such as Boston and San Francisco can train and mentor
