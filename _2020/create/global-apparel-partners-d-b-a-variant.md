Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Variant is a research and design incubator revolutionizing the fashion
  industry.  Utilizing proprietary 3D technology and sustainable materials, we
  empower businesses to create customizable products with minimal environmental
  impact via on-demand, localized manufacturing.
project_description: >+
  Variant has created a form-fitting knit mask made of fine gauge synthetic
  yarn, which is washable and can hold an N-95 grade filter.  We are currently
  working with the FDA to fast track approval for use of the mask by medical
  professionals, and are providing free automatic manufacturing instructions to
  industrial knitting machines throughout the country.  Additional partnerships
  and support would help us to accelerate the development and production of the
  mask, and continue iterating on the innovation.     


Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >+
  As a small business, we have seen firsthand how the COVID-19 epidemic has hurt
  our creative and manufacturing communities here in Los Angeles and abroad.  We
  have also been deeply affected by the reports and stories we have heard from
  medical professionals and front-line workers unable to receive the proper
  protection they deserve in order to fight this unprecedented crisis.  


  Our team at Variant immediately began to think about how we could use our
  expertise and resources to help our communities.  Inspired by the legion of
  fashion brands that began to create cut-and-sew masks for the general public,
  we sought to develop a mask that could be knit directly off a machine -
  requiring no additional steps to complete construction - and could hold an N95
  grade filter.  We are providing the program for creating these masks to any
  knitwear manufacturer for free, in order to help keep them operating and allow
  for hyper-local production and distribution of a much-needed item.


Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  The Variant team includes three of the garment industry’s leading knitwear
  innovators and technicians, with 100 years of experience between them.  They
  have created intellectual property for the world’s leading brands and can
  program and adapt elite machinery to create three-dimensional structures that
  require minimal sewing and integrate multiple yarns and textures.  


  Our technology team also has years of experience in creating digital
  toolchains, 3D visualization, and manufacturing.  


  One of our major goals as an organization has been to utilize knit machinery
  to bring innovative new products to market, and thus our processes and
  resources have already been refined to allow us to quickly create, test, and
  produce this mask.  


  In addition, as we are already active members in the manufacturing and tech
  ecosystem of Los Angeles, we have been able to secure initial partners for our
  first round of production and to launch this initiative.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  We define success by the following factors:

  - Our ability to produce on a large scale masks that can be used by front-line
  workers, and # of masks produced (both in the LA region and beyond)

  - Our ability to produce on a large scale masks for medical professionals, and
  the general public, and # of masks produced (both in the LA region and beyond)

  - # of knitwear manufacturers we empower to create masks through use of our
  program (both in the LA region and beyond)


  We will also seek to obtain federal funding to support the innovative
  properties of the mask and our digital manufacturing toolchain, in addition to
  patents where possible.


  Lastly, we define success by bringing an innovative new product to market that
  can be made quickly, locally, and with nearly zero waste.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '100000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Utilizing our innovative manufacturing approach and knit program, we initially
  project being able to produce over 1700 masks a day, with our factory partners
  located here in Los Angeles.  We will providing these masks for free, to
  medical professionals and those in the general public operating essential
  businesses (grocery stores, pharmacies, civic organizations, etc.).  On a
  broader sense, our work to refine a digital toolchain for manufacturers will
  strengthen the US manufacturing ecosystem and further build on our IP.  


  Our program empowers knitwear manufacturers to produce globally, and
  distribute locally.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  XponentialWorks is a venture investment, corporate advisory and product
  development company, specializing in Artificial Intelligence, digital
  manufacturing, 3D printing, robotics, and the digital transformation of
  traditional businesses.  We are utilizing their ecosystem to help raise
  awareness, speed development of the project, and to share the free program
  files we have created for knit machines.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Communications support
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: XponentialWorks
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Manufacturing activity
  - Federal research grant funding
  - Patents
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?: []
