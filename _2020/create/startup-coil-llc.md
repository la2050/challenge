Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Version One App Accelerator empowers entrepreneurs and small businesses to
  launch their mobile app technology without requiring them to have any software
  engineering skills.
project_description: >-
  Born out of the Startup Coil MVP program and in partnership with V ONE Inc,
  the Version One Accelerator helps small business owners and aspiring startup
  entrepreneurs launch native mobile apps.


  With the help of LA2050, the App Accelerator can offer scholarships to local
  entrepreneurs so they can take some of the difficult first steps toward
  success without needing to risk thousands of dollars on software developer
  costs. They will each emerge from the program with a fully functional mobile
  app and the business skills to keep making progress.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA

    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  mall business owners and aspiring entrepreneurs, though facing myriad
  challenges, almost always struggle with the technical hurdles of getting their
  early software developed quickly and affordably.


  We have built a program to rapidly move their projects forward which also
  guides them in best practices for building a sustainable product.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  After building the largest startup networking community in Los Angeles,
  feedback from our community members has made it clear that these are the
  greatest challenges and roadblocks for Los Angeles startup founders and small
  business owners.


  Our scope and experience, over 8+ years, has led us to this solution: The
  Version One App Accelerator.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our vision of success is to yield at least 50 fully launched mobile software
  products for LA2050 scholarship recipients within 6 months of the scholarship
  being implemented.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '50'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '50000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Underserved individuals in our city rarely have access to the resources to
  take the risks that entrepreneurship entails. We want everyone to have a
  chance to participate in the future of our economy and can, with support,
  deliver this access to dozens, and in time, thousands of Angelenos.


  L.A. can and will be the city of the future, and that starts by keeping our
  innovators here and giving them a chance to succeed.
