Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Bread Head’s mission is to empower young adults experiencing housing
  insecurity with food literacy, life skills, and positive relationships.  With
  our intentional community, we hope to inspire personal growth, independence,
  and balanced living.
project_description: >-
  The LA2050 Grant will expand our Community Ambassador program where we hire
  young adults in our community to do peer outreach for Bread Head programming
  and events around food literacy, health, and wellness. While the program
  intends to inspire hired ambassadors to strengthen job readiness skills in a
  workforce they are passionate about, it also addresses issues of social
  isolation and brings awareness to systemic challenges impacting housing
  insecurity, including: malnourishment, mental illness, generational poverty,
  and stigmatization.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Westside
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  In March 2019, we formed our Youth Advisory Board with the intention to gauge
  needs for PAN, our program to teach recently housed youth to cook on a
  CalFresh budget.  We left with an understanding of other serious issues: 1)
  Limitations of services for individuals experiencing houselessness. 2)
  Increased social isolation experienced when transitioning into housing, from
  both their community on the streets and the general population they are
  expected to assimilate to.


  This inspired adding two new programs: CHEW, which provides access to life
  skills around food literacy, health and wellness, and the Community Ambassador
  Program, where youth leaders are hired to engage the community to inform and
  access our programs.  Building community resources and goals of balanced
  living is critical, no matter where a person is in the housing process. 
  Conducting outreach at city-wide agencies, Ambassadors communicate barriers
  that perpetuate cycles of vulnerability and collaborate to find solutions.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  In April 2019 we met to interview our first Ambassador, a struggling young
  artist facing chronic housing insecurity.  For years they faced challenges
  related to mental health, gender identity, and job security.  Though they had
  participated in several programs within LA to address these challenges, they
  still felt unsupported in achieving balanced living. 


  Now, almost a year later, they have achieved stability and are thriving for
  the first time in years. Through their unique lens of lived experience, they
  help us shape our programs to be more inclusive, effective, and trauma
  informed. Bread Head empowers individuals with the tools and support systems
  needed to create change in their own lives, and inspires them to civically
  engage with the entire community. Through creating a model of outreach and
  advocacy that reflects the diversity of our community we build resiliency. Our
  current Ambassador is a valued staff member and their voice is incorporated in
  this grant narrative.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Success is measured on key indicators of balanced lifestyle and community
  resiliency: increasing engagement, retention, food security, life skills
  developed, sense of self-efficacy and social connection, and placement into
  continuing education or jobs.


  Some of the greatest challenges engaging the community are cultural relevance
  and consistency.  Our Ambassadors facilitate monthly Advisory Boards and
  outreach efforts to receive community feedback ensuring our programs remain
  relevant incentives that create solutions around barriers.  Through peer lead
  outreach, our community feels a sense of belonging and accountability to keep
  referring others and showing up.  We keep track of member attendance and
  impact of programming with validated assessments on longitudinal building of
  skills, steps towards achieving goals, and strength of social support.


  The Ambassador positions are contracted for one year, and their success in
  completing the program is measured by readiness and placement into workforce
  or secondary education.  There are many services for employment that typically
  refer clients to customer service or manual labor. While these are vital
  positions in the workforce, they don’t always inspire members to reach their
  full potential.  Participation in the program bridges this gap by creating
  case plans for the year that support action to create and achieve goals.  The
  last three months of the program support participants while they apply for
  next steps that inspire and motivate them.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '500'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '2000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Through Community Ambassador outreach efforts, we discovered patterns at
  shelters that caused people to return to the streets: mandatory in person case
  management meetings that caused youth to choose between their shelter bed or
  employment, and LGBTQ+ discrimination.  Communicating these concerns to our
  partners at DMH, it was discovered that shelter contracts lacked mandatory
  trainings for staff on trauma informed care.  Ambassador collaboration creates
  broader impact by informing system policies on quality of services delivered.


  Expansion of this program increases opportunities to discover barriers
  experienced at systems that touch the lives of our community, and empowers
  people with lived experience to collaborate and find solutions.
