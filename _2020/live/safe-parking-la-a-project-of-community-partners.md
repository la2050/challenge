Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Safe Parking LA (SPaLA), a project of Community Partners, supports people who
  are homeless and living in their vehicles by providing them with a safe place
  to park at night and connecting them with the supportive services and
  community programs they need to thrive.
project_description: >-
  Safe Parking LA seeks support for Neighbors for Home, a grassroots community
  engagement initiative that mobilizes local residents to act around the problem
  of vehicular homelessness in their own neighborhoods. In partnership with LA’s
  Neighborhood Councils, lot partners, and other local groups, SPaLA will
  activate a series of volunteer opportunities to support organizational
  capacity, promote positive interactions with people who live in their
  vehicles, and build change-making communities dedicated to solving the problem
  of homelessness.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  According to the LA Homeless Services Authority, more than 25% of the 58,936
  homeless people in Los Angeles live in their vehicles. The problem is worsened
  by the shortage of legal and safe places to park overnight. While Los Angeles
  taxpayers and local government have stepped up to support local homelessness
  initiatives that are making a big difference, Safe Parking LA believes that
  full transformation is rooted in long-term, community-based solutions.  


  About 15% of Safe Parking LA’s clients are employed full-time while still
  living in their vehicles, and 55% are working part-time or seeking employment.
  Most have low acuity scores (VI-SPIDAT) and are less vulnerable to further
  decline, making them ineligible for public programs like Rapid Rehousing and
  Flexible Funds. Changing the landscape for people living in their vehicles
  requires a unique approach pairing specialized case management with community
  support otherwise unavailable to safe parking clients. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Safe Parking LA is the largest safe parking program in LA, operating ten lots
  in the County. Working alongside our client services program, an innovative
  community engagement model has the power to help solve LA’s homeless crisis.  


  From inception, Safe Parking LA has partnered with key community leaders,
  including LA City and LA County, to secure funding, support existing
  infrastructure, and meet the community need. Lot partners include the LA
  County Dept. of Public Health, LA City General Svcs. Admin., LA Public
  Library, Dept. of Veterans Affairs, Beit T’Shuvah, IKAR, and St. Mary’s
  Church. 


  Safe Parking LA has already engaged members of several faith-based groups in
  lot coordination and other services. Some lot partners have provided
  supportive volunteer services to SPaLA clients on their property. In 2019, we
  hosted the first-ever National Safe Parking Conference with idea partner Leo
  Baeck Temple to share best practices, positioning us as a leader in the safe
  parking movement. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "Safe Parking LA will be successful when hire a Neighborhood Volunteer Coordinator and engage local volunteers in: \n\n●\tSupported On-site Lot Coordination: Volunteers welcome safe parking clients, collect basic information, and provide social engagement at lots. \n●\tSupported Client Outreach: Volunteers help connect prospective clients to safe parking and local resources. \n●\tSupportive Services: Volunteers provide services including dinners for safe parking clients.  \n●\tSupported Mentorship: Volunteers mentor safe parking clients to support education, training, work, and more. \n●\tTraining: Volunteers will get the tools they need to be effective in their service with extensive support from Safe Parking LA’s expert staff throughout the volunteer experience.   \n\nSuccess will be measured using the following benchmarks:\n●\tThree active Neighborhood Council partnerships established.\n●\tVolunteer toolkit completed and utilized with in-person training and ongoing engagement. \n●\tOn-site lot coordination yields two volunteers per night per lot.\n●\tClient outreach yields at least two volunteers ongoing per lot. \n●\tSupportive Services yields weekly community dinners per lot. \n●\tMentorship yields at least two pilot mentor-client partnerships per lot. \n\nBy introducing a new community engagement project to our innovative safe parking model, Safe Parking LA and LA2050 will be partners in change, powering our vision of an LA2050 without vehicular homelessness.  "
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '100'

Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  In its pilot year, Neighbors for Home will connect three Neighborhood
  Councils, 45 council members, and their constituencies to their local safe
  lots for service to people experiencing vehicular homelessness. We will train
  at least 100 local volunteers to support lot coordination, client outreach,
  supportive services, and mentorship. Volunteers will help more than 300 people
  experiencing vehicular homelessness in their own neighborhoods. To realize our
  vision of an LA2050 without vehicular homelessness, Safe Parking LA seeks to
  engage all 99 of LA’s Neighborhood Councils in Neighbors for Home over time.
  Through our work with Neighborhood Councils and other community partners, we
  will build a volunteer army to support change.
