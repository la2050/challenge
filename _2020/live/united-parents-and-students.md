Please describe the mission of your organization.: >
  United Parents and Students (UPAS) is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization
  empowering members of low-income communities to become powerful self-advocates
  for neighborhood revitalization by building permanent, self-sustaining
  coalitions of community members who demand positive social change.
project_description: >
  UPAS will partner with the American Heart Association and California
  FreshWorks to improve access to high-quality, fresh and affordable foods in
  underserved communities across Los Angeles. We will support LA County in
  adopting a Healthy Food Financing Initiative that incentivizes stores to offer
  nutritious food options and encourages healthy food businesses to set up shop
  in high-need areas, creating opportunities for better local health outcomes
  and food access while also increasing employment opportunities and promoting
  economic development.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - Westside

    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    LAUSD (please select only if you have a district-wide partnership or
    project)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Though life may be filled with challenges, being able to find a clean grocery
  store with fresh produce shouldn’t be one of them. In Los Angeles County,
  almost 30% of low-income residents struggle to find quality food. Low-income
  neighborhoods and communities of color are two to three times less likely than
  affluent or white neighborhoods to have access to nearby grocery stores with
  affordable and nutritious food, putting residents at disproportionate risk for
  obesity, diabetes, and other life-threatening illnesses like cardiovascular
  disease and cancer. UPAS is effective at helping communities organize, find
  their voice, and demand equitable access to the countless opportunities to be
  found in Los Angeles. The organization is proud to support its members’
  ongoing fight to put healthy food on their family’s tables.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Since its formation in 2011, UPAS has become a force for positive change in
  the communities it serves, winning major victories by building networks of
  parents, students, and community leaders and training them in the proven
  strategies of successful organizing. In 2018, members identified food justice
  as a shared priority. They have developed a report card to assess local
  supermarket quality, conducted evaluations of more than 20 stores across South
  Los Angeles, and awarded seals of excellence to those exemplifying
  high-quality service to their communities. The work has been supported by the
  LA Food Policy Council, which passed the 2019 Good Food Zones motion, and
  facilitated the LA County Board of Supervisors’ unanimous approval of the
  Improving Supermarket Quality motion, calling for the Department of Public
  Health to address food quality and food safety issues. Now is the perfect time
  for UPAS community leaders to take the fight for food justice to the next
  level.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  UPAS members will secure a commitment from a high-quality supermarket operator
  to open at least one new location in a low-income community. UPAS has
  partnered with the American Heart Association and California FreshWorks, an
  experienced, mission-driven lending network that supports businesses working
  to increase access to healthy food in California’s low-income communities.
  Both partners will support UPAS members in hosting meetings with six
  high-quality operators to raise awareness of the impact of food injustice, the
  needs of local residents, and the California FreshWorks investment program.
  Members will share their success in rallying community support for businesses
  showing commitment to, and care for those they serve. Direct partnership with
  grocery store operators will be supported by grassroots petitioning of LA
  County leadership to propose a motion to support the FreshWorks program and
  provide incentives for investment in healthy food enterprises in the city’s
  low-income communities. These actions will contribute to several long-term
  objectives of the LA2050 program: improving residents’ access to affordable,
  fresh produce; reducing food insecurity for people with low incomes;
  generating more equitable health outcomes for low-income communities of color;
  and increasing residents’ satisfaction with local government’s services,
  programs, and policies in response to their needs. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '125500'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  We envision a Los Angeles where the needs of residents in Watts are met as
  urgently as those in Pacific Palisades, where potholes on Alameda are filled
  as quickly as those on Beverly Glen, and where families in Boyle Heights can
  find the same healthy food there is in Santa Monica.This vision empowers
  low-income communities of color to recognize their political power and the
  tangible results of their agency. UPAS provides residents with training in the
  proven skills and strategies of successful organizing. We support members in
  identifying and evaluating the challenges they face and problem-solving
  effective, actionable solutions. In doing so, we help communities affect
  meaningful and lasting change for themselves and their neighbors. 
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
  - 'Office space for meetings, events, or for staff'
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: ''
