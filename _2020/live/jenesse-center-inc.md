Please describe the mission of your organization.: >

  Education and Training Programs; and Medical, Housing, and Public Benefits

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Jenesse proposes to address the multi-faceted barriers to safety and
  self-sufficiency that are experienced by low-income victims of domestic
  violence in South Los Angeles.

  The Los Angeles Police Department statistics show that Jenesse’s South Los
  Angeles service area which is home to just over 10% of the County’s population
  has one of the highest incidences of reported domestic violence in the city.
  Jenesse reaches these clients through our 24-hour hotline, email, or social
  media such as Facebook to seek out our services and we anticipate this number
  will continue to increase with the launch of the Jenesse App.

  Removing a victim from a violent home is just the first step in Jenesse’s care
  continuum. Jenesse’s experience shows that mental health issues and persistent
  poverty are the two primary issues that undermine victims’ efforts to escape
  and establish healthy environments for themselves and their children.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  In addition to the direct physical impact of violence, more than half of
  Jenesse’s clients experience mental health problems. These issues impact the
  victim’s ability to mobilize resources and protect themselves and their
  children and require the kind of trauma-informed behavioral health
  interventions provided at Jenesse.

  Also, the lack of employment and employable skills exacerbates the cycle of
  domestic violence (DV). The economic self-sufficiency curriculum that is
  taught in our entrepreneurial programs is a powerful tool to break the cycle
  of DV.

  Jenesse is uniquely suited to take this on because of its reputation for
  innovation and cultural competence, its experience in mobilizing multi-sector
  partnerships for the greater good, and its success in intervening to stop
  family violence across the generations. Jenesse has an unparalleled ability to
  work with historically marginalized clients with myriad issues stemming from
  inter-generational cycles of poverty and neglect.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  The goals of the proposed activities are to: 1) empower victims; 2) address
  the mental, physical and emotional ramifications of trauma; 3) help victims
  access the education, training, and skills needed to achieve self-sufficiency
  for the long term; 4) provide legal assistance to ensure safety and stability;
  and 5) provide permanent housing assistance to be able to find affordable
  housing and maintain it for themselves and their families.


  Jenesse tracks outcomes by surveying clients on changes in their
  self-confidence, coping skills, ability to manage anger, and parenting
  competency. Jenesse’s program-specific outcomes are: 1) reduced victimization;
  2) improved planning for survivors’ personal futures, including education,
  employment, housing, and family life; 3) increased awareness of options; 4)
  increased knowledge of domestic violence, and 5) decreased isolation—all
  necessary for achieving self-sufficiency and eliminating the patterns of
  abuse.


  Jenesse anticipates that:

  75% of clients report that they feel better able to make reasoned, realistic
  and positive life-choices due to living in a stable home environment;

  95% of program participants report increased knowledge of domestic and sexual
  violence and its effects and have safety plans in place to reduce the risk of
  further abuse;

  75% of those served show an increased awareness of options and resources
  available;

  70% of participants achieve specific goals with regard to improving financial
  security through education and/or gainful employment; 

  95% of the families remain housed within one year of leaving Jenesse’s
  shelter; and, 

  100% of program participants develop safety plans for reducing further risk of
  abuse.


  Jenesse’s Chief Operations Officer is responsible for ensuring that the
  agency’s programmatic and operational activities are monitored on a regular
  basis. Management and administrative staff are assigned monitoring
  responsibilities in areas such as Client Services; Client Satisfaction;
  Contract Compliance; Background and Security Investigations; Confidentiality;
  Insurance; Eligibility Requirements; Outreach Activities; and Financial and
  Progress Reporting.

  To ensure that high-quality services are consistently provided, Jenesse
  conducts monthly, quarterly, annual and random sampling of program,
  accounting, and administrative records. Corrective actions are initiated
  immediately when discrepancies are found.

  Additionally, interviews are conducted with each client upon exit from our
  program to gain input on their experiences while receiving services from us.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1900'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '2500'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Jenesse’s life-saving services help 1900 domestic violence (DV) victims to
  overcome barriers, access services, and establish lives that are free from
  physical, mental, emotional, economic subjugation, and violence. In addition
  to the victims who will receive direct services, Jenesse will train and make
  presentations to over 400 individuals, including law enforcement, teachers,
  faith-based organizations, and other experts in the field to help address the
  unique needs of DV survivors.

  Jenesse also works to break the generational cycle of violence through its
  Children and Youth Program that increases individual knowledge and skills
  among youth to prevent gender-based violence and educates them to learn what
  healthy relationships look like.
