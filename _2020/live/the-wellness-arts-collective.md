Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  The Wellness Arts Collective is committed to providing holistic services that
  support mental health and well-being, that is accessible to all. We aim to
  provide therapeutic space that is purposefully inclusive of the cultural &
  economic needs of  people across gender, faith, SES, and citizenship.
project_description: >-
  We strive to obtain funding that will expand our existing pro-bono
  psychotherapy & wellness services for folks in the community that are unable
  to pay. Additionally, we would like to continue to provide free venue space to
  health & wellness educators and practitioners -specifically, women, BIPOC,
  LGBTQ+, and/or (im)migrant -identifying facilitators- to extend (additional
  free or low-cost offerings) to the community who might not otherwise have such
  access.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - Northeast Los Angeles
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The National Alliance on Mental Illness reports that one-in-four individuals
  experiences a mental illness each year, underscoring a critical need for
  mental healthcare access across all patient populations. Access to holistic
  services that support mental health tends to be particularly our of reach for
  those who identify as LGBTQ+, BIPOC,  (im)migrant, and/or low income. That
  limited care access is not for lack of patient motivation. According to the
  National Council on Behavioral Health, 56% of surveyed individuals desired a
  mental healthcare provider, but faced care barriers. Access to mental health
  services outside of clinic and agency environments generally require that
  individuals have insurance, be able to pay out-of-pocket, or both. And even
  when an individual or family can find an affordable provider, lack of 
  practitioner availability, fragmented or ineffective care, and societal stigma
  are getting in the way of their access to holistic, culturally-competent
  services. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  We believe that access to holistic services that support mental health and
  wellness is a human right, and recognize that it is often out of reach for
  many, particularly those who identify as LGBTQ+, BIPOC, (im)migrant, and/or
  low income. Through our shift away from industry culture over the past 2
  years, we have sought to amplify Social justice; Cultural Humility,
  Sensitivity, and Inclusivity; Collaboration; Respect; Integrity; and
  Creativity. We also promote these same values internally, in order to create
  an atmosphere of open communication and mutual support. Through our sliding
  scale & pro-bono services we have offered compassionate, culturally-informed,
  and client-centered care to dozens of individuals and families in the Los
  Angeles community. This reach has expanded through our Residency program which
  offers use of our space at no-cost to artists, educators, and practitioners
  outside our practice in exchange for additional therapeutic services to the
  community at low or no cost.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our current success is simply measured by the fact that we are able to offer
  weekly sliding-scale and pro-bono services to existing clients and their
  families, and no-cost venue space to outside artists, educators, and
  practitioners, while simultaneously covering our operating expenses and
  ensuring that our clinical staff are able to earn livable wages without
  personal or professional burn out. We envision greatly increasing the number
  of both low-cost and pro-bono clinical hours as well as hours/space available
  through the Residency program through continued fiscal growth and support. At
  present, our sliding scale and pro-bono services account for over 35% of our
  clinical offerings, and we have designated 15% of our total space (hours) for
  our Residency programming. In the coming year, we would like to increase our
  low-cost and pro-bono services to 50% of our clinical services, and designate
  25% of our space for Residency offerings. In addition to these aforementioned
  increases, we would like to subsidize continued education and trainings for
  our clinical staff to further our overall mission and support for the
  community.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '40'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '490'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  Conservatively, through the extension of reduced-fee services, direct impact
  is a minimum of 30 individual clients per week/per year. Our indirect reach
  could impact a minimum of 120 additional people through the improved mental
  health of the clients, the de-stigmatization of mental illness, & subsequent
  mental health services accessed by those indirectly impacted (approx 60% of
  new-client referrals are from former/existing clients). Through the Residency,
  we can provide no-cost space to at least 10 facilitators and estimate that
  Residents will reach a minimum of 10 ppl/event at 4 events/Resident. Beyond
  the individual impact of attendees, we believe there will be an even broader
  impact as they share that information w/ their communities.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
