Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Our mission is to build a transparently run cooperative of backyard farms that
  provide sustainable and local food while keeping the majority of the money in
  the local economy. In all aspects of our practice we strive for economic,
  biological, and democratic sustainability.
project_description: >-
  With this funding, Huarache Farms will dramatically expand our current growing
  capacity. This will allow us to begin selling at three additional farmers’
  markets and deliver food to a far greater portion of LA County. We will
  reinvest in our community through on-the-job education. Our training will
  enable new farmers to provide for themselves and their communities. The
  willingness and workforce is there; our ability to provide affordable and
  healthy food is limited only by our capacity to expand.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: "According to the LA Food Bank 1 in 5 people live without any sense of food security. Locally grown, affordable, and healthy food is far too often the privilege of a particular population. While Huarache Farms has been a constant feature of the Atwater Farmers’ Market, our ability to bring healthy and affordable food is limited by our size. With a greater growing capacity we would be able to produce more food and meet the needs of a far larger population.\n\tProximity is, more now than ever, a serious concern. Even without a pandemic limiting mobility, people can simply not always afford to travel to a market on one specific day, at one particular time. Our Community Supported Agriculture delivery system allows us to bring food from our backyard farms to those in need who wouldn't have access otherwise.\n\tHuarache Farms is ready to expand to meet these needs. Our trained farmers are capable and excited to train new members and our capacity is limited by capital to expand.\n"
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  Huarache Farms currently has a base of land, farmers, and customers and is
  prepared to expand. Our cooperative structure provides clear processes for
  welcoming new community members, training them in sustainable farming while
  affording a career with a living salary. Each member is incentivized by a
  profit share based on their patronage. You get more than what you give!


  Our coop already has a scalable seed-to-sale process in place. Weekly, our
  community of backyard farms and farmers harvests, replants, and delivers
  hundreds of pounds of fresh produce to neighbors. It costs $15,000 to produce
  a 1 acre vertical farm in materials and labor. Once established, a 1 acre farm
  will require 46 hours of weekly labor and produce about $2,000 of revenue.


  The logistics of this farming operation is complex. However, by working with
  our partner, Sustaina, who is building the app to plan, delegate, and track
  every task in every farm.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our measures of success have 3 categories: the biological, social, and
  economic.
   
  Biologically Huarache Farms is dedicated to sustainability in all aspects of
  our production. We will farm 6.5 more acres in 13 backyard farms. We will
  install 1300 vertical growing towers and plant leafy greens, herbs, and
  veggies. Our techniques of drip irrigation are 10x more efficient than
  traditional agriculture and our polyculture diversity eliminates any need for
  pesticides. We aim for soil self-reliance through the installation of nearly
  three-hundred cubic feet of compost per acre. Our biological metrics include
  pounds of food produced, water consumed, soil produced, compost collected,
  customers served, markets serviced, food donated.


  Socially, we are a community of passionate and talented farmers. We engage the
  community and share the collection of wisdom, land, and food. Each farm is an
  amazing place to host events, tours, learning, and any opportunity under the
  sun! We measure our social success through recording the number of new members
  involved, the people who show up at our events.


  Huarache Farms is also a coop. Our business is governed by the farmers that
  grow. We are committed to keeping most of the money in our members’ hands and
  empower them to run their Coop of backyard farms.


  Metrics: The hourly rate for farmers and work opportunities will all be
  visible in Sustaina. Votes in the Coop will be tracked at meetings.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '800'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1000000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  We directly impact 3 groups of people with careers, families with new farms,
  and community consumers!

  We will produce about 7 full time jobs from $100,000 of investment. These will
  be living wage jobs of 50k annual salary and include voting rights in the
  coop.

  Additionally, an estimated thirteen families will benefit from receiving
  farming infrastructure on their yard. They will have access to farming
  expertise, food, and 5% of the profit share; about $3,500 / Acre annually! We
  are currently in Sun Valley, Altadena, and Sierra Madre, but would expand to
  areas where money is a bigger barrier of entry.

  There will be an estimated 800 individuals in the community that will have
  fresh and veganic, locally grown produce available to them.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: Sustaina Company
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Access to healthy food
  - Food insecurity
  - Water-use efficiency
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?:
  - LA is the best place to LEARN
  - LA is the best place to CREATE
