Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Our Mission: To offer a bridge to self-sufficiency and make available the
  necessities of life to people experiencing homelessness.
project_description: >-
  The Midnight Mission (TMM) offers a variety of programs for homeless
  individuals & families, the goal of which is to give program participants the
  tools needed to achieve & maintain self-sufficiency with the goal of
  preventing future homelessness. Program graduates are now living healthy
  lives, working successfully in the community, reunited with their families and
  living in permanent housing. We feel LA2050 Goals of LIVE fit perfectly within
  TMM’s current programs. 
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The Midnight Mission (TMM) offers a variety of life-saving programs for
  homeless individuals & families, one of which is our Healthy Living program.
  Most of those in this program come from a life of being homeless and suffer
  from drug, & alcohol and substance abuse disorders. While we know the problem
  of homelessness isn’t always associated with substance abuse disorders, we do
  know if there is a problem with this addiction, if it is not addressed, there
  is little to no hope for the person. Our Healthy Living program incorporates
  the already successful 12-step philosophy used in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA),
  combined with case management plans, which provide the tools needed to achieve
  & maintain self-sufficiency.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Our Healthy Living program has been in effect for over 45 years.  This program
  has shown its success by the amount of Alumni who are free from substance
  abuse, living happy, successful, and self-sufficient lives. This is a NO COST
  12- 18-month structured process for homeless male adults who want help to
  overcome their addiction. It includes sobriety support, health & wellness,
  education, job training & many other services geared towards providing our
  participants tools necessary to live a self-sufficient life. We transform
  lives through education, awareness, & behavior modifications we believe in
  helping our participants achieve a healthy balance between body, mind,
  emotions, & spirit.  . With strong educational, vocational, medical, legal,
  health & wellness resources, our program gives each person the tools to become
  self-sufficient & free from substance abuse. Because we don’t rely on
  government funding our need for grants and private funding are imperative. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "\tRecovery program participants will learn how to manage their addiction by attending 90% of their individual counseling sessions (1 session per week).\n\tParticipants will learn how to interact with their peers, gain self-awareness and interpersonal skills by attending 100% of their psycho-educational groups (2 groups per week).\n\tClients will examine their life choices and learn how to solve their problems by attending 100% of their case management conferences (1 session per week).\n\n"
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1300'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '7800'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  15% who are homeless suffer from chronic substance abuse, those on Skid Row,
  62% report a substance abuse problem.  Addiction affects family relationships,
  physical & mental health, fiancés, employment & housing stability. A study
  conducted by NIDA has shown that over 1/2 of the estimated costs of addiction
  were associated with criminal activity. According to NIDA, “every $1 invested
  in addiction treatment programs yields a return of between $4 and $7 in
  reduced drug-related crime, criminal justice costs, and theft alone. When
  savings related to health care are included, total savings can exceed costs by
  12-1.” For every graduate of TMM’s Healthy Living program, hundreds if not
  thousands of people are positively affected. 
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
