Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Peer Health Exchange's mission is to empower young people with the knowledge,
  skills, and resources to make healthy decisions.  We do this by training
  college student volunteers to teach a skills-based health curriculum in under
  resourced high schools. 
project_description: >-
  With LA2050’s support, Peer Health Exchange will train nearly 315 college
  student volunteers to teach a 14-week skills-based health program to over
  3,350 9th grade students in under-resourced communities across LA. Through our
  skill-based curriculum we aim to increase help-seeking behavior for high
  school students experiencing poor mental health.  
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - South Bay
  - >-
    LAUSD (please select only if you have a district-wide partnership or
    project)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  In Los Angeles young people navigate difficult decisions around their mental
  health, sexual health, and substance use. Many young people first begin to use
  substances to deal with depression or anxiety. Young people in high poverty
  communities are even more likely to become pregnant unintentionally, are less
  likely to seek help when feeling sad or depressed, and are more likely to use
  substances as a coping mechanism for stress and other mental health
  challenges. Despite the need for high-quality health education and coordinated
  services with health systems, schools often do not commit adequate resources
  to deliver effective health education and connect students to health resources
  in their communities. PHE helps fill this critical gap in the provision of
  effective heath education and connects students to the preventative care they
  need across Los Angeles. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  There are a handful of organizations in LA that serve to educate young people
  with health education. However, what makes our program unique is our use of
  neer-peer health educators, our focus on mental health, and overall our
  evidence-informed health education curriculum that incorporates pedagogical
  best practices and focuses on skill-building in support of health.  This not
  only distinguishes our model from other health education programs but also
  improves our impact on youth.  As slightly older peers, PHE's college-aged
  health educators are well positioned to lead honest conversations about high
  school students’ choices and health.  We have found through evaluation of our
  program that the high school students are often more comfortable asking
  sensitive and challenging health questions of college volunteers than a
  traditional teacher.  
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >+
  Student reach results are an important measure of success for us, but most
  important is the quality of our program, as measured through student impact
  tools.  Peer Health Exchange regularly measures our impact on students’
  abilities to make healthy decisions through formative and outcomes evaluation.
  Outcomes evaluation methods include pre- and post-tests and exit slips. We
  benchmark our annual results against our external evaluation post-test data
  and relevant national data in order to understand our ability to sustain and
  grow our impact. 


  In 2014, PHE invested in an external evaluation conducted by the American
  Institutes for Research (AIR) to learn what works and doesn’t work in our
  model. The study included 4,000 students, comparing those who received PHE to
  those who did not. We found that our program has a statistically-significant
  positive effect on mental health knowledge, skills, and help-seeking behavior.
  The majority of these outcomes persisted after a following year without PHE.


  By the end of the 2018-2019 program year, students in LA reported that PHE was
  helping to inform their decision-making around health.

  -  86% of students indicated “PHE influenced my decision to advocate for my
  own health.”

  -  83% of students indicated “PHE influenced my decision to seek help if I am
  experiencing poor mental health.”


  We expect to see similar results at the end of the school year. 


Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '3350'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '315'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >+
  At the end of the program, we hope to have much impact in the community
  including: 

  - increasing students’ health knowledge, skills, and intentions

  - educating more students on knowing how to access mental health resources. 

  - becoming the missing link between the classroom and the health center and
  helping young people access more individualized resources

  - building college volunteers’ leadership and teaching skills and developing
  their awareness of health equity issues 

  -  fostering a strong sense of community on college campuses, and building
  volunteerism in their community

Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - 'Office space for meetings, events, or for staff'
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: ''
