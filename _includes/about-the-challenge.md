LA2050 is a community-guided initiative driving and tracking progress toward a shared vision for the future of Los Angeles centered around [five goals and tracked via 65+ regional progress metrics](/about/#goals). <br /><br /><strong>The My LA2050 Grants Challenge is an open call for ideas to make LA the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live.</strong>

We need your help to turn the LA2050 goals and metrics into action.

<strong>A total of $1,000,000 will be awarded among 25 organizations</strong> to implement their proposals. Each organization will receive grant funds and [partnership from LA2050](/about/#la2050-partnership) to support its efforts. Additional funding and prizes will be awarded by [this year's My LA2050 partners](https://challenge.la2050.org/partners/).

## Selection of Winners

Winners will be selected via a two-step process:

**25 finalists will be selected by an external evaluation committee of community leaders, led by Social Venture Partners Los Angeles.** As our evaluation partner, SVP will review and score applications to determine five finalists in each goal category.

Finalists will be selected using the following criteria:

* Impact on chosen [LA2050 goals and metrics](/about/#goals)
* Feasibility of proposal
* Impact on people served
* Overall application quality

Finalists will represent a diversity of issues and activities. For more information, view the [full scorecard](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11Wk6lF_aHEq4tljPPkvnNAZl07JrUjzX).

**Award levels will be determined via public vote.** Voters will determine which organizations place first ($100,000), second ($50,000), third ($25,000), fourth ($15,000), and fifth ($10,000) in each goal category. All 25 finalists that participate in the voting stage will receive a grant, with five grants distributed at each dollar amount (e.g., there will be five $100,000 winners).
