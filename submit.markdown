Your application will go through a simple moderation process to ensure that it adheres to all challenge rules. Applications that make it through the initial vetting will be published on the My LA2050 Grants Challenge website on {{ site.ENTRIES_SHOWN_ON_THE_WEBSITE_DATE | date: "%A, %B %-d, %Y" }} to allow the public to read about and engage with the proposals. Our external evaluation committee of community leaders, led by Social Venture Partners Los Angeles, will review and score applications to determine five finalists in each goal category (a total of 25 finalists).

From {{ site.VOTES_BEING_ACCEPTED_DATE | date: "%A, %B %-d, %Y" }} ({{ site.VOTES_BEING_ACCEPTED_TIME }}) through {{ site.VOTING_PERIOD_ENDED_DATE | date: "%A, %B %-d, %Y" }} ({{ site.VOTING_PERIOD_ENDED_TIME }}) the 25 finalists will move on to the public voting phase. Public vote will determine the winners' final award level. First place in each category will receive $100,000, second: $50,000, third: $25,000, fourth: $15,000, and fifth: $10,000. The winners will be announced via the <a href="{{ site.mailing_list_url }}">LA2050 Newsletter</a> on {{ site.WINNERS_ANNOUNCED_DATE | date: "%A, %B %-d, %Y" }}.

### Regarding COVID-19 and Activity Restrictions
We understand how difficult it is to plan for a year-long grant period in our current context. 
We plan to be accommodating and flexible with our 25 winners, working with them over the course of their grant to adjust planned activities according to evolving public health guidelines and to ensure there is space to respond to emergent needs.

And, while weâ€™d love to be optimistic and assume that in-person gatherings will be permitted sometime between now and the end of the grant period in August 2022, we canâ€™t be sure. For that reason, please ensure that the activities described in your application align with current Los Angeles County public health guidelines, such as restrictions on in-person gatherings, except for those activities deemed essential (e.g., food distribution, medical services, etc.). 

If you anticipate that guidelines in Los Angeles County will change in the next year to allow for your organization to conduct activities that are currently restricted (e.g., in-person educational instruction) please explain on your application what you will do under both circumstances.

Please note that applications that do not account for COVID-19 restrictions and precautions may be disqualified. If you have any questions, please feel free to email connect@la2050.org.
