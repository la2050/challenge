## LA2050 is a community-guided initiative driving and tracking progress toward a shared vision for the future of Los Angeles.

With the support of 30,000 Angelenos, we’ve outlined an [aspirational vision](https://la2050.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/reports/1/pdfs/vision_for_a_successful_los_angeles.pdf) centered on [five goals](/about/#goals): to make Los Angeles County the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live by the year 2050. We’re also tracking our progress by evaluating [65+ metrics](https://www.la2050.org/metrics) that assess how Los Angeles is faring.

In 2013, we launched our first signature program, the My LA2050 Grants Challenge, to inspire action and move the needle on the goals and metrics. Through the grants challenge, more than 1,500 creative and innovative proposals were submitted to build a better LA. With the help of hundreds of thousands of individuals who voted on their favorite proposals, LA2050 has granted more than $7 million to more than [85 organizations](https://archive.la2050.org/search/?keywords=winner) shaping a brighter future for Los Angeles.

And now we want your help to continue working toward a brigher future!

## About the My LA2050 Grants Challenge

This is an open call for ideas to make Los Angeles County the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live. A total of $1M will be awarded among 25 organizations—five per goal category—to implement their ideas to turn inspiration into impact. Each organization will receive an award of between $10,000 to $100,000 to support its efforts.

The proposals should aim to engage Angelenos to make a specific, tangible impact on one of the [LA2050 goals and metrics](/about/#goals) over the next year.

LA2050 will also commit to a one-year partnership, leveraging its resources, assets, and networks to help the projects succeed. Together, the winning organizations, LA2050, and Angelenos will create progress for the region that will change the course of our future.

## LA2050 Partnership

We want to work together! For winning proposals, LA2050 will offer the following partnership opportunities:

* Leverage the LA2050 community to support and participate in the project.
* Offer communications assistance to build awareness and thought leadership, including authoring articles and blog posts.
* Amplify messaging on social media and via the LA2050 newsletter to support projects.
* Create design assets as needed.
* Provide technical assistance, strategic input and guidance, and access to experts to incorporate insights on the project.
* Offer access to professional development programming and capacity-building workshops.
