## What is the My LA2050 Grants Challenge?
</summary>

The My LA2050 Grants Challenge is an open call for ideas to make Los Angeles the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live. A total of $1M will be awarded among 25 organizations—five per goal category—to implement their proposals. Each organization will receive an award of between $10,000 to $100,000 over one year to support its efforts.

LA2050 will also commit to a one-year partnership with the winners—leveraging its resources, assets, and networks to help the projects succeed. Together, the winning organizations, LA2050, and Angelenos will make progress for the region that will change the course of our future.

## How should we plan for the next year given the evolving circumstances of COVID-19?
</summary>
We understand how difficult it is to plan for a year-long grant period in our current context. 
We plan to be accommodating and flexible with our 25 winners, working with them over the course of their grant to adjust planned activities according to evolving public health guidelines and to ensure there is space to respond to emergent needs.

And, while we’d love to be optimistic and assume that in-person gatherings will be permitted sometime between now and the end of the grant period in August 2022, we can’t be sure. For that reason, please ensure that the activities described in your application align with current Los Angeles County public health guidelines, such as restrictions on in-person gatherings, except for those activities deemed essential (e.g., food distribution, medical services, etc.). 

If you anticipate that guidelines in Los Angeles County will change in the next year to allow for your organization to conduct activities that are currently restricted (e.g., in-person educational instruction) please explain on your application what you will do under both circumstances.

Please note that applications that do not account for COVID-19 restrictions and precautions may be disqualified. If you have any questions, please feel free to email [connect@la2050.org](mailto:connect@la2050.org).

## What kinds of projects are you looking to support?
</summary>

We’re open! But here are some ideas about what we’re looking for:

* Bold ideas that will produce measurable wins for the LA region
* A spirit of collaboration and desire to unify and amplify collective efforts

## Does the program have to serve all of Los Angeles (City or County)? 
</summary>
No! Your project may serve our broader region or zero-in on a particular neighborhood, community, city, or region in Los Angeles County. It’s up to you.

## We are a small organization with a small social media following. How can we compete with larger organizations in voting?
</summary>
In general, we’ve seen both small and large organizations do well in the voting stage. It’s less about the size of your list, and more about knowing how to correctly engage the audience you do have. If you do get to the voting stage, we provide EVERY finalist with a GOTV guide full of social media copy, graphics, and ideas for engaging your network. Ultimately, we’ve found that social media is only a small contributor to the outcome of voting and that you don’t need a massive following to do well in the voting period.

## Can I submit more than one application?
</summary>

There can be multiple proposals from the same organization, as long as the submissions are unique and in different goal categories. However, we would recommend consolidating your resources, collaborators, and supporters to submit one awesome proposal!

## What are some tips for submitting ideas to the My LA2050 Grants Challenge?
</summary>

Think about impact. Be imaginative and audacious. We want to hear your most ambitious ideas – but we also want to know that your project is feasible, implementable, and that it could impact the [LA2050 goals and metrics](/about/#goals).

Collaborate. We are eager to see folks working together to improve Los Angeles.

Share how your proposal will impact the LA2050 goal you are focusing on. For example, if you’ve chosen the ‘Learn’ category, you might describe how your proposal will improve graduation rates; if you’ve chosen the ‘Connect’ category, you might explain how your proposal will increase voting rates or volunteerism.

Be sure to explain why you think the strategy and methods are the best course of action for impacting the goal and metrics.

Please include an image that represents your idea or organization. You’ll get the best results if you send us the highest resolution image you have. We recommend avoiding a lot of text or logos in your images, as we may have to crop them to fit our site. Images should be in JPEG, or PNG format.

Videos can also help quickly articulate your project or your organization’s mission. To include a video, first upload the video to a place like [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) or [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/), and then include the URL for the video with your application.

Applicants should not expect to be able to revise their applications after the submission date.

Read [full application guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/139CzkwrSXywm7LZpGmyEZSCYBR6aQKiK/view?usp=sharing) and preview the [evaluation scorecard](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KvHgPWGyfiR9eolVdlEckDGpwUszq7_3/view?usp=sharing) to get a more precise idea of what we want to see.
