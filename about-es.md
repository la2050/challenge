## LA2050 es una iniciativa guiada por la comunidad que impulsa y rastrea el progreso hacia una visión compartida para el futuro de Los Ángeles.

Con el apoyo de 30,000 residentes de LA, hemos delineado una visión aspiracional centrada en cinco objetivos: hacer del condado de Los Ángeles el mejor lugar para aprender, crear, jugar, conectarse y vivir para el año 2050. También estamos monitoreando nuestro progreso mediante la evaluación de más de 65 métricas que evalúan cómo le está yendo a Los Ángeles.

En el año 2013, lanzamos nuestro primer programa principal, el My LA2050 Grants Challenge, para inspirar la acción y avanzar en los objetivos y métricas. A través del desafío de subvenciones, se presentaron más de 1,500 propuestas creativas e innovadoras para construir un mejor LA. Con la ayuda de cientos de miles de personas que votaron por sus propuestas favoritas, LA2050 ha otorgado más de $7 millones a más de 85 organizaciones que dan  forma a un futuro mejor para Los Ángeles.

¡Y ahora queremos tu ayuda para seguir trabajando hacia un futuro más brillante!

## Acerca del My LA2050 Grants Challenge

This is an open call for ideas to make Los Angeles County the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live. A total of $1M will be awarded among 25 organizations—five per goal category—to implement their ideas to turn inspiration into impact. Each organization will receive an award of between $10,000 to $100,000 to support its efforts.

The proposals should aim to engage Angelenos to make a specific, tangible impact on one of the [LA2050 goals and metrics](/about/#goals) over the next year.

LA2050 will also commit to a one-year partnership, leveraging its resources, assets, and networks to help the projects succeed. Together, the winning organizations, LA2050, and Angelenos will create progress for the region that will change the course of our future.

## LA2050 Partnership

We want to work together! For winning proposals, LA2050 will offer the following partnership opportunities:

* Leverage the LA2050 community to support and participate in the project.
* Offer communications assistance to build awareness and thought leadership, including authoring articles and blog posts.
* Amplify messaging on social media and via the LA2050 newsletter to support projects.
* Create design assets as needed.
* Provide technical assistance, strategic input and guidance, and access to experts to incorporate insights on the project.
* Offer access to professional development programming and capacity-building workshops.
