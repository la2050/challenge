Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Kaimore is a nonprofit aimed at breaking down barriers to economic mobility.
  The core of our efforts is to provide targeted professional development and
  financial coaching services for disadvantaged individuals. Through this, we
  hope to help our clients develop financially sustainable lifestyles through
  flourishing careers and financial management.
project_description: >-
  We believe access to the workforce should be egalitarian. Sadly, the real
  world doesn’t always operate on the principle of equal opportunity. Aspiring
  workers often face social barriers because of their ethnicity or economic
  circumstances. To tackle this problem, Kaimore has developed a 16-week
  development experience filled with financial coaching, workforce training,
  project-based learning, field work and a final philanthropy project for
  ambitious individuals to help realize their full potential as community
  leaders.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Kaimore seeks to address financial insecurity and unemployment. Access to
  banks, mortgages, loans, retirement accounts, and good financial advice is
  critical to establishing long-term financial security. However, over 9 million
  American households lack a bank account. Some 60 million adults use high-cost
  lending products, around half of whom are African Americans and Latinos,
  despite qualifying for standard loan products. Households with poor credit
  history and lack of emergency savings will spend nearly 10 percent of their
  income on high-cost credit products. Debts disproportionately impact families
  and communities of color, hindering economic mobility.  Unemployment further
  exacerbates financial instability. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of
  St. Louis, unemployment rate in January 2021 in LA County was 12.7%.
  Re-employment and job retention will be crucial to rebuilding Los Angeles in
  the coming years, and Kaimore hopes to be part of the solution and long-term
  change.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  We will host three Career Accelerator Programs focused on addressing low
  financial literacy and unemployment in marginalized groups with lower
  socioeconomic backgrounds such as those previously incarcerated or domestic
  abuse victims. The curriculum integrates introductory courses, case studies,
  hands on projects, individual assignments, internships, and mentorship
  opportunities.  Weekend bootcamps will cover 1) basic financial coaching on
  savings, budgeting, banking, taxes, and credit scores and 2) professional
  development training programs including resume editing, networking, career
  panels, and utilizing LinkedIn. Over the course of the first half of the
  program, members will work on case studies that dive deeper into topics of
  their choice, along with group projects and individual assignments. During the
  second half of the program, members will conduct fieldworks, participate in
  internships, or work on individual projects that will help them secure
  employment in the industry of their choice. During the final 2 weeks, members
  will use skills learned from the program to host a philanthropic event for
  their community, benefiting Los Angeles while solidifying their leadership
  skills.  Members from each class will have the opportunity to become mentors
  for following cohorts and join the growing Kaimore Accelerator alumni network.
  Ultimately, the Kaimore platform will serve as a bridge to connect those who
  are in need to who are able to help.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Since our founding, Kaimore has served over 800 low income individuals in 2020
  alone through partnerships with City of Los Angeles, LAOC Apprenticeship
  Readiness Program, neighborhood councils, Family Source Centers, HACLA, and
  more. Between 2018-2020, 90.3% of our clients reported at least a 25% increase
  in savings, 87.4% of individuals improving their credit score by at least 35
  points, 89.9% number of individuals with at least 25% reduction in debt, and
  85% of individuals set and completed a 6-month long financial goal. Kaimore
  placed 63 out of 84 individuals enrolled in our pilot workforce development
  program into jobs despite the pandemic. The metrics we use to measure impact
  include: documenting number of unduplicated at-risk families enrolled,
  analysis of client changes in financial wellbeing as measured by the pre- and
  post- service survey, employment rate, and 3-6 months job retention rate. 
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  This grant would allow Kaimore to positively impact the lives of those that
  are underprivileged in Los Angeles. The LA Almanac reported that in December
  2020, the unemployment rate in the LA County alone was at 10.7%, around
  521,600 individuals. According to the United States Census Bureau, the median
  income for the city of LA is around $29,000. We are projected to increase the
  number of clients by 90% by 2023, and we would have the potential to
  positively influence the lives of almost 1,500 low income clients, which is
  about .3% of the current unemployment population. If they can secure a median
  wage job through our curriculum at $29,000/yr, then that would be an
  additional $43.5M/yr for the LA economy. We will ensure more members of our
  program will be able to reach or exceed this statistic. Professional
  development and financial literacy is not easily accessible in the current
  world, but Kaimore is proud to communicate essential information that will
  effectively develop our clients.
