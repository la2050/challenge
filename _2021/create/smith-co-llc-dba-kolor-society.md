Please describe the mission of your organization.: >
  To provide a rebirth of the community experience that fosters lifelong
  relationships and learning.
project_description: >
  This grant will support Mastermind Groups that offer peer-to-peer mentoring to
  minority and women owned businesses to solve problems and increase revenue.
  Every month Kolor Society and Innovative Entrepreneurs Hub partner with
  Startup Grind South LA to host mixers that highlight startups, founders,
  innovators, and creators. These business owners reveal challenges and a desire
  for a shared space to discover solutions, resources, and increase revenue.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  In 2012, US Census data suggested that Los Angeles County led the nation in
  the number of minority owned businesses. South Los Angeles is ripe with
  emerging, new and seasoned business owners. Every month at Startup Grind South
  L.A., attendees mention their pain points -- marketing, accounting, access to
  capital, just to name a few. While resources are readily available to help
  entrepreneurs succeed, individuals are skeptical and bombarded by information
  overload. Entrepreneur magazine suggests “eight of every 10 businesses flop
  within the first 18 months of operations” (2017). This suggests businesses
  lack the support to trudge through challenging situations. This is especially
  true for minority-owned businesses in South L.A. where there is a dearth of
  Mastermind Groups. We aim to form Masterminds led by successful business
  owners who will assist South L.A. entrepreneurs with knowledge and skills to
  overcome barriers to success.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  As Founder of Kolor Society, I am uniquely suited to lead this project based
  on my status as a minority owned and women-led business. While I have
  experienced success in gaining members and facilitating impactful events, the
  thought leadership of peers and business leaders who have done it before could
  have mitigated my learning curve. In 2015, I participated in a Mastermind
  Group led by the Los Angeles Urban League that was helpful in providing
  peer-to-peer support. However, the Mastermind lacked facilitation by a
  successful business owner. Now, five years later there is still no strong
  Mastermind in South L.A. to assist minority entrepreneurs in scaling up their
  businesses. Kolor Society can meet that need with the formation of Kolor
  Mastermind, the solution to provide a space for deep and focused learning and
  support.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  We will define success by the completion of eight mastermind groups in the
  period of one year. Our goal is to help approximately 50 business owners
  overcome challenges, implement solutions quickly, and increase revenue.  
   
  We will measure success using the following data points: 

  Number of Mastermind participants

  Number of peer-to-peer connections

  Number of collaborators

  Types of industry of businesses

  Increased profitability of each business by a minimum of 10%

  Increased skill set of each participant by a minimum of 3 skills
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '50'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '270000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The Mastermind Groups will serve approximately 50 minority and women owned
  business owners with physical spaces in South LA and/or affecting South LA
  residents.

  We will require that business owners have been in operation for one year or
  more, have a consistent revenue, and customer base. We will encourage
  participants from industries that lack minority representation such as,
  “professional, scientific, technical, information, and financial-related”
  (Journal Review, 2019). Participation and success in the mastermind group will
  affect families, customers, South L.A., and the broader communities. Tax
  revenues generated from businesses provide much needed services for the
  community. When small businesses thrive, the community thrives.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >
  Innovative Entrepreneurs Hub (IEH) will offer access to conference rooms,
  business branding services, business credit consultations, and financing
  options. 
   
  Startup Grind South LA will hold monthly events which will serve as an entry
  point to reach small business owners. They will assist in marketing the
  mastermind groups. Their partnership with Google for startups will allow
  participants access to countless business building tools, ability to apply for
  up to $100,000 on the Google Cloud Platform, and discounted tickets to the
  Startup Grind Annual Global event in Silicon Valley.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Communications support
  - 'Office space for meetings, events, or for staff'
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
  - Access to successful business owners
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: Innovative Entrepreneurs Hub; Startup Grind South Los Angeles
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Minority- and women-owned businesses
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?: []
