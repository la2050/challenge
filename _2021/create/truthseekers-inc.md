  entertainment industry, training youth to broadcast their frequency through
  contemporary mediums is essential now more than ever. Our program aims to
  respond to this new chapter of online media consumption, training youth of all
  ages to bring quality content to their respective communities.
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >+
  This project is important work to our organization as we recognize developing
  needs of resources among our target population during the global Pandemic.
  With the new landscape of working from home, many are faced with spending much
  more time online. The best way to utilize this new chapter is to provide LA
  with empowering innovative media, while training youth on how they can create
  their own platforms for their own communities to use their voice for sharing
  their own unique truth. Our project gives audiences a relief from disposable
  social media, with an entity that combines the awareness of social media
  alongside curated wellness education and marketing of local artists and small
  businesses. Truthseekers is uniquely suited to take this on with over decades
  of accumulative experience in the professional music/TV/film industry,
  spanning across both analog and digital backgrounds, we are able to bridge the
  gap and lead a new generation of voices to create a better Los Angeles for
  all.

What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: >-
  We define success for our project by directly training students to become
  their own show hosts to curate their own programming after completion of
  internship. We will measure success by logging listens, streams, downloads,
  and follows of our live broadcasts platforms online. Our vision of success for
  this project is more programming on our network that features youth creators,
  producers, storytellers, artists, engineers, etc.


  We plan to increase local LA's creative community through the awareness of our
  organization, our mission, and services we offer on a global scale through the
  power of the internet as we represent LA's diverse arts and culture.


  Obtaining funding and stability to maintain facilities and hire necessary
  staff to carry out the programs will increase professionals involved with our
  organization. Operating our organization in the most effective and efficient
  manner possible will better serve our participants. We'll continue developing
  our name within the community, building strong reputation for delivering the
  highest quality services possible. We'll build long-standing relationships and
  partnerships with other organizations in the community that share our vision.


  Finally with our community cultivation efforts throughout the year, we'll
  create an annual event to promote awareness to neighborhood businesses,
  educating people on our innovative health and wellness approach for creatives
  in LA with our diverse backgrounds, multigenerational homes, and unique
  artistry.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '100'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '10000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The impact of our proposal allows Los Angeles to increase its metrics in
  creative opportunities for youth with a well rounded program to launch their
  entertainment industry experience with live broadcast and media production. By
  incorporating virtual workshops into our internship, we will reach a wide
  range of next generations of broadcast talent through the internet, especially
  in this time of uncertainty in the performance industry and global quarantine.


  Our platform and projects will serve as building blocks to bridging an
  international alliance.

  We will empower individuals to experience deeper connection and understanding
  of different cultures through the lens of Los Angeles, as they discovery and
  feature artists from around the world.
