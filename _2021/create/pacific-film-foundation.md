Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Our vision is to support U.N. Sustainable Development Goals with documentary
  films and TV series. We have 15+ films, e.g., Prison Transformations (2009);
  With One Tied Hand (2016); and Pershing’s Paths of Glory (2020). In
  development today is a new TV series:  Female and Finally Free (anticipated
  release 2022). Our proposal integrates this series.
project_description: >-
  Pacific Film Foundation (PFF) dedicates a channel to support UN Sustainable
  Development Goal #5:  Achieve Gender Equality. PFF is developing a TV series,
  Female and Finally Free. For LA2050, PFF would invite LA County women and
  girls to send short video "entries" about  achieving freedom from constraints,
  e.g., abuse, eating disorder, poverty, incarceration, bullying,
  discrimination, and others. Moderated videos would be streamed for public
  voting with winners earning a series casting shot.

There has been progress: More girls are going to school, fewer girls are forced into early marriage, more women are serving in positions of leadership, and laws are being reformed to advance gender equality. •\tDespite these gains, many challenges remain: discriminatory laws and social norms remain pervasive, women continue to be underrepresented at all levels of political leadership •\tWomen are paid 16% less than men. •\tOne in four managers are women. •\t31% of young women are not in education, employment or training. •\tOnly 40% of women who experience violence seek help of any sort. •\t1 in 5 women and girls between the ages of 15 and 49 report experiencing physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner within a 12-month period. •\tWomen need more access to finance in order to be on an equal footing with men."
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  PFF is committed to help meet U.N. Sustainable Development Goals by being a
  creative hub via streaming channels dedicated to the goals.   For example,
  U.N. Goal #5: “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.”   
  Led by Dayle D. Hartnett, Ph.D., PFF is developing the TV series, Female and
  Finally Free, reaching out to women who will tell their personal stories of
  becoming free from constraints. These stories may be about surviving abuse,
  imprisonment, or bulling; or, suffering from postpartum depression, an eating
  disorder, or poverty; or, about victory over any adversity.   For LA2050, we
  would use the grant to invite females throughout LA County to send their
  self-produced video story to
  https://pacificfilmfoundation.org/gender-equality-5 for posting on the
  streaming Channel 5 – Gender Equality. We will then invite Website visitors to
  view the stories and review/vote for the story(ies) they believe in (stories,
  reviews, and votes moderated). PFF’s ultimate goal is to develop, produce, and
  ultimately distribute this episodic series so that women and girls around the
  world can be inspired by these courageous examples. For LA2050, we would focus
  on stories celebrating girls and women in LA County who have broken free of
  constraints, and one or more of these stories could become part of the
  episodic series.  PFF owns the URL, http://femaleandfinallyfree.com and would
  develop and launch the site as part of the LA2050 grant.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': "PFF will use ANSWER 9 categories as success measures of LA2050 Female and Finally Free, plus:  Sponsorship revenue:  PFF intends to recruit brand sponsors of the TV Series, including the following criteria: Committed to UN Sustainable Goal #5 – Gender Equality Committed to UN Sustainable Goals #3, #13, #16, #17 Have written into their corporate standards an “equal pay for equal work” rule  Audience growth: Working with multi-cultural audience professionals, e.g., EthniFacst/Nielsen, we will accurately measure the number of multi-racial and multi-cultural audience members we reach.

"
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '21000'
