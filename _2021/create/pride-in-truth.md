Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Pride In Truth is a new nonprofit based in the communities of Los Angeles. 
  Our mission is to strengthen and heal our communities in a meaningful way.  We
  walk with the youth and incarcerated people by welcoming them back into
  society with reentry services and educating them on a pathway of leadership
  for their own growth.
project_description: >-
  The My LA2050 Challenge will provide Pride In Truth everything needed to
  launch the Braz Project. The Braz Project will uplift individuals impacted by
  the incarceration and legal systems by providing wrap around ReEntry support
  such as immediate needs services; vocational and education pathways;
  alternatives to suspension/expulsion, court, and incarceration; and programs
  for local youth after school. In doing so, we seek to break the chains of
  slavery and cultural hegemony that have oppressed our communities and families
  for generations.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  More than 1/3 of the CA prison population under CDCR custody comes from or
  paroles to Los Angeles. Despite being hyper criminalized and incarcerated for
  generations, East Los Angeles has very few resources and safe spaces in the
  community that serve as alternatives to suspension, expulsion, court,
  detention, and/or incarceration. There are even fewer agencies that assist
  formerly incarcerated and directly impacted individuals with their successful
  re-entry back into society.    The problem is that East Los Angeles is a
  resource desert - trauma informed and culturally relevant support is a
  scarcity for people directly impacted by the legal system and their
  families.   Our community needs more safe spaces where people can receive wrap
  around support to heal from their trauma and the cycles of violence,
  incarceration, and death that have been perpetuated throughout generations of
  families. It is time for people from the community to create new
  transformative networks of care. 
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  We Are Currently Working in the Future.   We strive to prepare directly
  impacted community members to sustain successful lives and take over
  transformative, community care work when we are gone. The My LA2050 Challenge
  will provide Pride In Truth with everything needed to launch The Braz
  Project.  The Braz Project will uplift individuals impacted by the
  incarceration and legal systems by providing wrap around ReEntry support such
  as immediate needs services; vocational and education pathways; alternatives
  to suspension/expulsion, court, and incarceration; and programs for local
  youth after school.  By working with local service providers, educational
  institutions, job industries, neighborhood councils, and elected officials,
  the Braz Project will strengthen the existing nexus of community care that
  families and directly impacted individuals can utilize to seek support and
  healing from their traumatic experiences.  One major principle of Pride In
  Truth is to encourage and teach personal autonomy; where all community members
  and leaders are able to make choices regarding the direction of their own
  actions in ways that they are most comfortable and empowered in. We hope for
  this project to be an inspiration for our members to replicate and lead their
  own businesses or initiatives that better their communities. In these ways,
  The Braz Project will break the chains of slavery, incarceration, and cultural
  hegemony that have oppressed our communities and families for generations.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We hope to change lives, but we do not see numbers as useful indicators of
  genuine relationship building.  We can measure success by how many members we
  retain; how many are released from incarceration; how many post-incarceration
  do not recidivate; how many sustain jobs or graduate from school; and how many
  are empowered to begin their own community-based initiatives. We will also
  measure success by how many youth are diverted away from the school-to-prison
  pipeline and are on a positive path of self-development and civic
  empowerment.   We will also know the Braz Project is positively impacting our
  communities based on social and cultural changes. For example, we hope for
  East LA to have a better understanding and responsiveness to trauma-informed
  and healing-centered approaches to justice. We strive to inspire impacted
  youth and adults to have a different perspective in the world; where they are
  free from oppression and confident that they can turn their experiences into
  power.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '50'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The Braz Project will help Los Angeles County transform into a safer and
  healthier place for future generations to be free from cages; to be educated
  and empowered community leaders with integrity, honesty, and empathy; to be
  their own business owners and community service providers; to have a deep
  understanding of the history and legacies of colonization and slavery; and
  thus to be committed to the sustainable healing and progress of their
  community.   This work will create a positive pipeline to support youth and
  adults that are directly impacted by the legal and carceral systems. This
  pipeline will begin from inside juvenile detention and adult incarceration
  facilities and guide individuals on a positive path throughout their
  successful reintegration and growth in the community.  We hope for The Braz
  Project to be a model for other empowered leaders to replicate, begin their
  own initiatives, and mushroom the nexus of community-based care providers in
  Los Angeles.
