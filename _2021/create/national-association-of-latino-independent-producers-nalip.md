Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Addressing the underrepresented Latinx community, our mission is to discover,

project_description: >-
  NALIP’s Latino Lens Program aims to champion the work and careers of Latinx
  and diverse creatives and industry professionals. Through Incubators,
  Workshops, and Mentorships, this program allows professionals in all divisions
  of media and entertainment to share their voices and create meaningful
  representation within the industry. Incubators provide creatives with
  real-world experience that elevates their content, workshops that educate
  future industry decision makers, and mentorships that build community between
  emerging and advanced creatives.

    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Within entertainment, the lack of diversity and inclusion both in front and
  behind the camera is critical. Los Angeles is rich with creative professionals
  from all communities, and their skills and potential are groundbreaking. These
  creative professionals, however, often lack resources, knowledge, and access
  needed to take their careers to the next level.


  Often stuck at a barrier of entry into the next phase of their development,
  creatives navigate through the tumultuous workforce, losing their passion for
  telling authentic stories. NALIP is a data driven, solutions based
  organization, and we see that the amount of talent from diverse backgrounds is
  not reflected in the workforce across all media platforms. The Latino Lens
  program not only aims to incubate projects that will serve as calling cards
  for creatives, but also to educate and guide through mentorship and workshops.
  NALIP recognizes the need to support these unique and talented voices that
  will impact the community-at-large.
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >-
  For over 20 years, NALIP has advocated for and supported talent from
  underrepresented communities. NALIP’s Latino Lens Program was created to
  address the discrepancies amongst Latinx and diverse creatives in the realm of
  professional development. This program, rooted in incubation, education, and
  mentorship, is uniquely suited to address these discrepancies often seen with
  emerging and mid-level talent.


  NALIP is a nonprofit organization uniquely positioned to take this on as there
  is a proven track record of providing it’s constituency with programs that
  offer direct resources to further their professional development. Past program
  participants have seen success through this targeted approach and have
  expressed interest in seeing the generation of more programs that can offer
  practical tools such as incubation, mentorship, and hands-on experience. With
  support from grants, NALIP can expand its programs and reach creatives looking
  for tools and opportunities to advance their careers.
What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: >-
  NALIP seeks to measure the success of this Latino Lens program by evaluating
  the number of participants supported, growing the reach and engagement of
  creatives across Los Angeles County, increasing the industry mentors, as well
  as the projects incubated and produced. NALIP wants to maximize the number of
  case studies, through this grant, we will be able to support inclusive content
  and help to create calling cards that can be used to advance careers. We will
  be able to grow the number of workshops and participants that attend and are
  in need of resources. Participants will have access to insight about the
  industry and hands on training from seasoned professionals. A very important
  component to this program is the ability to track these individuals past
  completion, to provide additional support and thus increase the chances of
  success. 


  NALIP has created a pipeline of talent, and recommended participants for
  positions in the media. In 2019, NALIP secured 40+ individuals with full-time
  jobs. NALIP has incubated 40+ projects that led to distribution deals,
  licenses and development deals. 


  For these programs, success will manifest itself in the form of 4-5 short
  films incubated, an increase in the number of workshops hosted, and number of
  mentors engaged. NALIP’s programs have been proven successful in guiding
  filmmakers, and this grant would allow the organization to provide more
  scholarships, workshops, and mentorships to those who demonstrate significant
  need. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '400'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '5000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  NALIP’s Latino Lens will have a broader impact on the industry-at-large by
  providing a platform for emerging to mid-level creatives from underrepresented
  communities to further their professional development. The need for diversity
  in film is well documented by the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative: “Across
  1,335 directors over 12 years, only 4.3% were female and 3.2% were Asian, with
  no change occurring over the 12-year time frame. Of the 112 directors working
  on the 100 top films of 2018, 2.7 % were Latino and 3.6% were Middle
  Eastern/North African.” Virtual mentorship sessions will allow us to scale our
  reach and impact. NALIP is working to improve representation in TV and film,
  not only in Los Angeles, but globally as well.

  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
  - 'Office space for meetings, events, or for staff'
