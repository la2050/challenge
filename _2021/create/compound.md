Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Compound, located in the Zaferia district of Long Beach, is the newest
  cultural complex in southern California dedicated to the intersection of
  contemporary art, wellness, and community impact. Compound’s unique mission is
  to provide equal access for free, culturally inclusive wellness resources and
  art programs to the local community.  
project_description: >-
  Art for All is a series of artist-led family workshops, virtual programs,
  onsite activities, take-home art projects, and a portable programming pod that
  brings arts education to all nine districts of Long Beach. At Compound our
  educational partner is Slanguage, a renowned artist collective, that has
  radicalized arts education for 25 years. We intend to raise non-status quo
  narratives that have been silenced and buried, speak truth to power, and
  reactivate public space through equity and access.

'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Art and access do not always go hand in hand, particularly in our sprawling
  city that is often divided along socioeconomic lines. Though Long Beach is
  located in one of the wealthiest counties, 22.8% of its residents live at or
  below U.S. Federal Poverty Guidelines. At Compound we are doing things
  differently. We are aware that culture is not neutral. Compound aims to
  mitigate structural inequalities by fostering free programs that can be
  experienced safely from a variety of locations. We believe that culture shifts
  consciousness.  With the support of partners such as LA2050, Compound will use
  Art for All to bring renowned artists and educators into the public realm
  throughout all nine districts of Long Beach through portable arts education.
  Bringing arts education literally into the streets ensures direct engagement
  and impact between our artists and new audiences. In light of the hardships of
  this trying year, we have seen the transformative power of our programs on
  families. 
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Compound will take Art for All directly into the city, bringing portable
  programming pods to each district of Long Beach. Art for All invites artists
  to produce engaging and accessible artistic programs and workshops for
  families and has done so virtually during the pandemic, bridging contemporary
  art, wellness and social impact.   Our collaborating artists have created
  projects in response to the concept of Radical Empathy over the course of the
  multiple phases of quarantine. This traveling version of Art for All will
  increase equitable access to recreational and creative space, and provide free
  opportunities for arts education and enrichment.   Compound will collaborate
  with local artists, such as mentor and teacher Rudy Almazan, who founded
  Creativity Ascending. He has launched a youth-for-youth movement that teaches
  design and screen printing, with the mantra "For Youth From the Ground Up."
  Almazan distributes art supplies to community children, and brings art to
  local youth through portable screen-printing at neighborhood parks in Long
  Beach. We will collaborate with Rudy and fund his efforts under the Compound
  Art for All umbrella.   Our educational partner Slanguage, founded by Mario
  Ybarra Jr. and Karla Diaz, will run the lab to support the development of
  innovative ways of thinking about education, creative process, contemporary
  social issues and community through Slanguage programs "You Got to See It to
  Be it," and Teen Council.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Long Beach has a mere 3.02 acres of recreational space per 1,000 residents,
  which is far less than Los Angeles, which boasts 8.10 acres per 1,000 people.
  In Long Beach, both municipal poverty rates and the lack of recreational and
  creative space underline the severely unmet need for free and open access to
  wellness-promoting activities such as Art for All.   Art for All has launched
  virtually during the pandemic year, providing virtual space for recreation and
  reflection. We measure impact through the growing numbers of participants. Our
  ever-expanding audience and direct testimonials from children and families who
  have participated, define our success. We are humbled by participants who've
  shared that our virtual programs have changed their lives. At Compound,
  through arts education, breath-work, meditation, and culture forums unpacking
  the intersections of race, society, and representation, our participating
  children and families see their unique experiences affirmed and expanded.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '6500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our traveling arts education will remove barriers to recreational and creative
  space, such as geographic proximity and cultural familiarity, allowing
  communities to co-create new art and ideas in real time. Compound will bring
  arts education into our streets and into the city where audiences can directly
  engage and collaborate with artists.  Art for All will empower populations who
  may not otherwise have access, to participate in innovative educational
  creative workshops outside of the context of school and traditional
  institutions.   Our virtual programs have already proven their deep impact,
  providing space for recreation, reflection, and transformation: one child and
  one family at a time. Our community must heal from the psychological and
  social tolls of this year. Through our continued commitment to access and
  equity, Compound will go directly into the communities we want to serve. Art
  for All contributes to our cultural reset through hands-on arts education and
  community-building.
