Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Venice Community Housing works to reduce homelessness, maximize affordable
  housing, empower low income constituents, provide social services and advocate
  for public policy that protects and strengthens the economic, racial and
  cultural diversity of Venice & other neighborhoods on the Westside of LA.
project_description: >-
  VCH kindly requests support for its art installation project, an activity of
  the organization’s Arts Community Collective (ArtsC2) committee. ArtsC2's
  purpose is to implement visual arts within Venice and provide a valuable
  cultural opportunity for VCH tenants, Venice residents, and surrounding
  communities. The art installation project is a manifestation of this purpose,
  as VCH strives to add public art installations (i.e. murals, sculptures,
  landscape design, etc.) to its permanent supportive housing and affordable
  housing properties. 
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Westside
In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  VCH is honored to be a past LA2050 recipient and watch four murals come to
  life. Tenants at each mural site have been engaged, as their voices are lifted
  through art. They feel empowered and proud of their homes. Because tenant
  feedback has been so positive, VCH wants to bring art to more buildings. 


  Many talented artists submitted applications. While VCH could only hire four
  lead artists, we want to utilize more of the talent in that pool, as well as
  grow the base of artists. This group will be invaluable as VCH continues the
  development of Reese Davidson Community (RDC) - 140 units of affordable and
  supportive housing, 25% of which will be for low-income artists. RDC will also
  have a community arts center and spaces for public art. VCH aims to eventually
  create art installations on every property it owns, making art a meaningful
  part of every Venetian’s life. The continuation of this project moves VCH into
  a broader role as cultural provider, improving public and common space.  
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >-
  In addition to providing housing and services, VCH works to sustain the
  diversity of Venice and to address interests of low-income residents through
  advocacy at the local, state, and national levels. Through volunteer
  engagement, community organizing, and collaboration, VCH leverages its
  connections to achieve lasting change for more people. By building strong
  community leaders, VCH supports their efforts to speak for themselves and
  create change. This foundation in grassroots community organizing puts VCH in
  an excellent position to expand its advocacy work into the arts realm. 


  VCH’s art installation project is developed, managed and executed by ArtsC2.
  ArtsC2 has both internal VCH staff members and external members. External
  members include VCH tenants, local artists, and community members, so that
  experts in art inform the decision making process, and those who were formerly
  unhoused make sure the process is inclusive and reflective of marginalized
  populations.
What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: >-
  The following goals have been established for ArtsC2’s 2020-2021 art
  installation project:


  1) Complete four art installations on schedule, as outlaid in project
  timeline.

  2) Install an interactive children's art station at VCH’s Westminster TLC,
  which provides short-term housing to families who are experiencing
  homelessness. TLC provides temporary housing and supportive services while
  families identify options for permanent housing. The 32-bed building has room
  for up to eight families. The interactive art station will be a space where
  children living on-site can draw and create together.

  3) Add 25 new artists and artist apprentices to pool of candidates via the
  previously established RFP process.

  4) Identify affordable housing supporters through community engagement and
  arts events.

  5) Create 12 temporary employment opportunities for the community – one lead
  artist, one artist apprentice, and one community liaison at each four art
  installation sites. 


  Success will be defined by creating art installations on four of VCH’s
  properties and an interactive children’s art station at TLC by summer of 2021.
  VCH will measure this by monitoring that the hired artists complete their
  projects in the given time frame, that each project has two community
  engagement meetings prior to beginning the art installation, and by gaining
  new supporters for housing developments in VCH’s pipeline, as measured by the
  submission of support letters. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '300'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '40000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Research shows correlation between murals and social/cultural/economic
  benefits, as well as positive impacts on mental health (opticosdesign.com).
  According to PolicyLink, public art initiatives have been identified as an
  advancement strategy for economic development of populations at risk of
  displacement as a result of gentrification. 


  Low-income communities and communities of color have long used art to survive
  racism. Through art, oppressed communities tell stories that promote healing.
  Public art acts as a megaphone for marginalized people to extend their voice
  and demand equity. VCH has found all of this to be true - murals promote a
  sense of identity, belonging, and welcoming in low-income buildings. 
'Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.': >-
  The organizations listed as partners on this proposal are members of the
  ArtsC2 external committee. The external members include VCH tenants, VCH
  program participants, local artists, and interested community members.
  Including external committee allows ArtC2 to gain the support of the community
  and obtain advice and assistance in areas in which we may not have experience.
  Many of the external committee members come from other nonprofits and art
  organizations, making ArtC2 a truly collaborative effort. The internal and
  external members meet to discuss items such as the distribution and review of
  Request for Qualification submissions and artist selection for the
  installations. Representatives from these arts organizations also assist with
  interviewing potential artists.
