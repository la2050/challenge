Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  To provide a platform for disabled people to jump-start a career in the film
  industry where they otherwise wouldn't be able to. And to use that platform to
  educate the film industry, and other industries, about the power of
  accessibility and diversity.
project_description: >-
  A children's show that merges ASL and spoken English languages exposing kids
  to topics ranging from the basics to emotional issues akin to Mr. Roger’s
  Neighborhood.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Burbank
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  This is our immediate response to the fact that 85% of deaf kids don’t have
  families who sign. As a deaf person we grew up witnessing firsthand the
  damages lack of access can have on a person. Secondly, many studies prove that
  ASL contributes to cognitive development for kids, not just for deaf people
  but for hearing kids as well. Signing is the fastest growing trend for infant
  education. Equipping and educating them to communicate earlier whether it be
  words or expressing feelings allows them to further develop their emotional
  maturity. In merging both demographics, we aim to fill in the gap for those
  who are deaf, nonverbal, and visual/tactile learners. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Warehouse TV is run by deaf people from very different backgrounds who have
  firsthand experience in this and are invested mind, body, and soul in this
  cause. Warehouse TV being run by deaf people means we all are bilingual as
  well, and can better serve the bilingual community. 


  Specifically for our project, we have connections with various professional
  psychiatrist and counseling organizations that can provide guidance about
  emotional development, such as Deaf Hope in Louisiana, and Sound Health in
  Seattle. 


  As far as credibility as individuals, one of our staff has an MFA in film
  (Jules Dameron), and another one of our staff is an Emmy winner for his work
  on "Deaf Code" (Chase Chambers). As a whole, we have pooled our resources and
  acquired a large arsenal of filming and photography equipment available to us
  at moment's notice, a dedicated studio space in Burbank, and a wonderful team
  of experienced filmmakers.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  When our project makes it into classrooms in schools nationwide as educational
  materials, and developing long-lasting partnerships with other organizations
  with a common goal, like LEAD-K, is our ultimate metric of success. 


  More immediately we aim to help kids learn, and more importantly, equip them
  with the tools to understand the world around them even if they live in a
  household with limited communication. Having children thrive in life making
  educated choices is the very core of what we hope to succeed. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '800000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1000000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The target audience of this series is both for children whether they be deaf
  or hearing, and for parents who need to learn sign language and have a way to
  connect with their children through the language. There are at least 800,000
  deaf and hard of hearing children in the United States and only 15% of these
  have a family who make the effort to learn sign language to communicate. This
  is mainly because of a lack of access to information and materials. In the
  case of a household that does not communicate well, we aim to be a source that
  kids can depend on to learn vital pieces of information that would not
  otherwise be accessible to them. Hearing children will benefit from the show
  just as well with captions, voice-overs, and exposure to ASL.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Communications support
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: ''
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - 'Arts establishments, instillations, and exhibitions'
  - Employment in the creative industries
  - Minority- and women-owned businesses
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?:
  - LA is the best place to LEARN
  - LA is the best place to CONNECT
