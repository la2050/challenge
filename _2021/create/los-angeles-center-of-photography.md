Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  The Los Angeles Center of Photography (LACP) is a non-profit center dedicated
  to photography and the education of the photographic arts. LACP serves people
  of all ages, experience levels and backgrounds who are interested in learning,
  teaching or being part of a community of photographers.
project_description: >-
  Over the past two decades, the Los Angeles Center for Photography (LACP) has
  supported photographers from beginners to professionals. Adults and kids from
  a broad spectrum of backgrounds have learned foundational and cutting edge
  photography techniques that have empowered them to tell compelling stories and
  reach their fullest potential of self-expression. My LA2050 will allow LACP to
  continue to advance our programs and to grow and fulfill our mission by
  offering more free events and exhibitions, as well as scholarships for
  underserved kids.

In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Photography as a way of communication is now more important than ever. The Los
  Angeles Center of Photography (LACP) wants to respond to this by becoming the
  photo hub in LA and offering more exhibitions, classes, scholarships and free
  community events. In 2019, LACP moved to a huge center with a dedicated
  gallery/event space, darkroom, library, classrooms and a print lab. As a
  community hub, LACP can provide anyone interested in photography the ability
  to take a class, print their work, see an exhibition of local and world-class
  photographers, hear speakers, use our library and meet fellow photographers.
  LACP also provides over $250,000 in jobs for artists who are employed as
  instructors and staff members, and offers the ability to earn credits for
  classes through our work-study program. Lastly, LACP provides free weekly
  classes to underserved kids through LA County Boys & Girls Clubs. LACP wants
  to provide a place for anyone who wants to express their creativity through
  photography.
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >+
  Over the past two decades, (formerly as the Julia Dean Photo Workshops and
  then as the non-profit, the Los Angeles Center for Photography), LACP has
  become the largest photo center in California, supporting thousands of
  beginners through professional artists in this influential practice. Adults
  and children from a broad spectrum of backgrounds have learned foundational
  and cutting edge photography techniques that have empowered them to create
  compelling stories and reach their fullest potential of self-expression. Each
  year LACP offers over 150 workshops and classes and teaches over 1,000
  beginning, emerging, and professional photo enthusiasts, exhibits over 300
  photographers, creates over $250,000 in jobs for working artists, and teaches
  free classes to 100 underserved children.  Additionally, LACP connects with
  over 10,000 photographers through our social media channels and online. With
  our new center, we are now uniquely suited to increase creativity in LA.

What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: >+
  This grant would permit LACP to expand our community reach tremendously by
  becoming a central hub. LACP would create new teaching opportunities, train
  new photographers with skills, offer scholarships to teens, and increase the
  number of exhibitions and free community events in our galleries.


  We now have a huge center, but we need the resources to increase our workforce
  and an increased presence online to reach our goals.


  Our vision for success for this project is to -


  1) Create a new website. This is the first thing most people see before they
  even set foot in the center and it needs updating. A new website, with speed
  and more capability will reach more people in Los Angeles to discover our
  community, learn, teach, enjoy talks, lectures and and meet fellow
  photographers. This website is crucial for showing who we are and all that we
  have to offer, as well as displaying the work of our Members, Teachers and
  Students to the world.


  2) Increase our free lectures, artist talks, programs and exhibitions
  throughout the year. These events would offer hundreds of people the
  opportunity to exhibit and view work, as well as meet fellow artists and
  network. 


  3) Offer scholarships for summer and weekend classes for local and
  under-served youth. There is a great need in Los Angeles for children to find
  creative outlets and we would like to expand our free offerings to meet that
  need. With new teachers and more staff hours, we can offer monthly classes for
  local and underserved youth, as well as offered scholarships to participate in
  our weekly summer youth programs. 


  4) Increase staff hours. We currently have 2 full time and 4 part-time staff
  who manage 150 classes, 6-8 exhibitions a year, bi-monthly evening events,
  membership, fundraising, and much more. Increasing staff hours will help
  facilitate new classes, events, train new teachers and work-study staff, write
  grants and plan fundraisers to ensure the success of LACP for years to come. 


  5) Hire new teachers to teach classes to underserved youth as well as to
  adults. There are many artists in LA looking for teaching jobs and we could
  employ more of them to teach our classes or online. And we can reach
  underserved youth, like we have been doing at the Boys & Girls Clubs
  throughout LA County and offer scholarships to our classes.


  We would measure the success by


  1)The development of a new website within a year.

  2) Increase in classes and student enrollment over the 1 year period by 10% or
  more (currently we teach approximately 1,000 students a year)

  3) Increased events and the attendance at our events by 20% (currently our
  events reach approximately 1500 people annually)

  4) Increase Social Media reach by 15% (currently we reach approximately 10000
  people on 4 platforms).

  5) Increase Membership by 10% (currently we have 910 Members)

  6) Offer 2 scholarships in each of our weekly summer teen programs (16 places)
  and free monthly classes in fall and spring for 15 students per semester.

  7) Increase staff hours by 15% (currently the p/t staff collectively works 100
  hours a week)

  8 ) Hire 6 new Instructors to teach new teen and adult classes. 

Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '65'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '6000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >
  LACP will impact the city of Los Angeles by adding more creativity to this
  vibrant city, as well as by inspiring, connecting, training, and employing
  creative people. Photo-enthusiasts of all ages and from all areas of the city
  will be impacted. LACP also now has online programs, so those who live at a
  distance from the center can still enjoy many of these same programs. 


  Our project will directly impact the web design firm hired, the six new
  instructors, the four part-time staff members and the 46 students who receive
  scholarships for the youth classes. It will indirectly impact all who attend
  our events, exhibitions, classes and programming at LACP, as well as those
  reached online and via social media. 
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
