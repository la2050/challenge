Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  The mission of Inner-City Arts is to engage young people in the creative
  process in order to shape a society of creative, confident, and collaborative
  individuals. We envisions a society that honors the human capacity for
  creativity, and values its cultivation in the education of young people.
project_description: >-
  Through a major expansion of our in-school program, Inner-City Arts will help
  close the equity and access gap on arts education for LAUSD students. With the
  expansive of digital platforms and tools now available (and recent integration
  of virtual learning on a wide-scale due to COVID-19), we will combine 30 years
  of hands-on experience with new virtual tools, to bring the highest caliber of
  sequential, curriculum-based arts education to the broadest segment of LAUSD’s
  least resourced classrooms, educators, and communities.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    LAUSD (please select only if you have a district-wide partnership or
    project)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  As LAUSD’s largest and longest-standing arts education partner, Inner-City
  Arts has a front row seat to the entrenched (well-documented) problem of
  students from lowest-income communities, particularly students of color,
  receiving the least and lowest quality arts education – and we think that’s
  unacceptable in a city so rich with creativity. 


  Also, this year we approved a new Strategic Plan, and a key need we identified
  is expanding access beyond our Campus. As a result, we have been experimenting
  with technology to make what we do available virtually, and on a much broader
  scale. 


  We had no idea how immediately relevant this would prove – when faced with
  school closures due to COVID-19, we were able to jump right into virtually
  serving students. Now that we’ve seen what’s possible, we are inspired to do
  something big. After we make it through this crisis, let’s use virtual
  learning to dramatically scale-up our in-school day program to expand arts
  education for LAUSD students.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Inner-City Arts has been partnering with LAUSD for three decades, and we have
  extensive in-depth relationships with LAUSD teachers, administrators – we even
  have a long-standing friendship with the bus drivers’ union. At every level,
  we are experts in navigating LAUSD’s multitude of complexities.  


  Another important ingredient for us is an inexhaustible ambition to see all of
  L.A.’s students receive a top-notch arts education. COVID-19 has had one
  silver lining as we see it – it’s transformed how we look at virtual learning.
  Now we have a working model and an entire team ready and able to implement.
  This creates a powerful and timely opportunity to make a big dent in expanding
  arts education access – starting with our most historically underserved
  students. 


  For all of these reasons, we are in a unique position to successfully lead a
  large-scale, city-wide effort to make arts education more widely available via
  a combination of in-person, hands-on, and virtual learning. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  For us, project success is clearly measurable using the following questions –
  Are we significantly increasing the percentage of LAUSD students receiving
  arts education as part of their school day? Is the programming in which
  students are participating comprehensive and of the highest quality? Are
  educators reporting positive impact of participation, as evidenced by
  improvements in students’ academic outcomes, and Social Emotional Learning
  outcomes? We will answer these questions by methodically collecting
  quantitative and qualitative data, pre- and post-participant surveys, and
  classroom observation. 


  Since our founding, research has continued to confirm what we experience in
  our studios every day, that the arts play an essential role in supporting the
  creative, social-emotional, and academic development of our youth. Inner-City
  Arts has a deep commitment to evidence-based evaluation and over the past 30
  years, we have worked with highly-qualified and respected program evaluators,
  including the Department of Education, the Center for Collaborative Education,
  the Centers for Research on Creativity, UCLA Graduate School of Education and
  Information Studies, and Indiana University’s Bloomington School of Education.
  In total, we have participated in nine comprehensive external evaluations,
  supporting our own programs and contributing to the fields of Arts Education
  and Educational Research.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '15000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '150000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Our project’s intended population are students at Title 1 schools,
  prioritizing partners based on current access to arts instruction (using
  LAUSD’s Arts Equity Index). The broader impact of our proposal is that we go
  from serving typically 5,500+ primarily low-income students and their teachers
  each year, to transforming hundreds more classrooms across our city, with the
  potential to reach thousands more students (as indicated by rough estimates
  listed above). This means also supporting more educators with training in arts
  integration to support whole-school, systemic change in underserved
  communities on a scale never before possible. We cannot imagine a more
  effective and important investment in the future of our city.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Communications support
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
