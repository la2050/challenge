  Believe in Music’s programming gives crucial access to innovative arts

  Children who grow up in low income households typically lack access to
  innovative arts education. Through our unique programming and music industry
  and community partnerships we are able to make this possible.

  rate of 90%

  technology programs have the largest impact. Technology access opens endless
  doors to creative opportunities for advancement in college and careers.
