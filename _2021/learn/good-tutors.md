  This grant is to triple the capacity of Good Tutors, a program currently
  providing customized 1:1 virtual tutors and book clubs to 400 PreK-12th grade
  students in underserved LAUSD communities. Organizations like LMU, Occidental
  College, and the Jewish Federation provide our volunteer tutors. What
  differentiates Good Tutors is that we ask each student- "what do you wish you
  could learn?" Our tutors are custom matched to fit the academic, social &
  emotional needs as well as the desires of each student to inspire a love of
  learning.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Social isolation and COVID-19 learning loss have alarmingly widened gaps in
  academic performance that have persisted in LA County public schools for
  decades. LAUSD is the 2nd largest school district in the nation, serving
  600,000 students, 80% of whom live below the poverty line.  While parents in
  our underserved communities work tirelessly so that their children may attend
  college and the promise of a better future, language barriers are in the way.
  61% of LA County parents are non-English speaking and typically unable to help
  their children with homework. Tutors or college guidance are inaccessible and
  unaffordable.   The inequity in educational support has been further widened
  by the digital divide, a systemic lack of computers & internet access at homes
  in low income communities. As a result, many students unnecessarily wind up in
  remedial classes. While 82% of LA students graduate high school, only half
  meet UC / Cal State requirements and less than 34% attain a bachelor’s degree.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  This grant provides funding to triple the capacity of Good Tutors, a
  successful ongoing 1:1 virtual tutoring program, currently serving 400
  underserved students in LAUSD. Good Tutors exclusively focuses on students who
  are eligible for free and reduced lunch. Volunteer college and high school
  students, senior citizens, retired teachers, professors, and college guidance
  professionals offer 1:1 free virtual tutoring.  A silver lining of COVID-19 is
  an unprecedented opportunity to narrow the digital and academic divide, thanks
  to the City of LA, LAUSD, and telecom carriers offering free devices &
  internet access. Good Tutors leverages this new online access to provide
  educational and emotional support to underserved LAUSD students.   Good Tutors
  succeeds because we take the time to get to know each tutor, student and
  family. We purposefully pair them to meet our students' academic and social &
  emotional needs. If the fit isn't right, we find another tutor. We begin by
  asking- "What do you wish you could learn?" The curriculum is then custom
  tailored to the needs and desires of each student.   Our program supplements
  students' school-based learning. Volunteers help students with 1:1 homework
  and language support, host group book clubs, and explore the arts. All tutors
  are background checked through Megan's Law, and tutoring takes place via Zoom.
  An empathetic heart, reliability, and subject proficiency are the principal
  requirements that we look for in our tutors.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Over the past 12 months with more than 12,000 tutoring hours, Good Tutors has
  proven that its 1:1 tutoring program has a meaningful impact on students and
  tutors. We define student success by increased academic performance and social
  & emotional growth. Parents, tutors, and teachers overwhelmingly report
  increases in grades, engagement, learning interest, and confidence.  Some
  stories we celebrate include Sherry, a 6th grader who passed the
  reclassification exam, testing out of remedial classes, forever altering her
  future. The mother of Karie, a 3rd grade student, said Karie's teacher asked-
  "what did you do to Karie? She's ahead of everyone in math and confidently
  speaks up in class."  We also define success by impact on our tutors. Student
  tutors have formed school clubs to recruit tutors and share best practices.
  LMU partners with Good Tutors in their School of Education and Center for
  Service and Action. They report that their Good Tutors have grown and greatly
  enjoy the program.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our goal is to continue innovating and scaling our program until 100% of
  PreK-12 students living below the poverty line in LA county have access to
  volunteer tutors and college guidance. We believe that Good Tutors will be an
  important contributor to achieving LA2050 LEARN and CONNECT goals such as ELA
  proficiency, college matriculation, volunteerism, and social & emotional
  support. Tutoring will make college a reality for students who never thought
  it was possible. With years of experience in 1:1 instruction, tutoring will
  inspire students to choose teaching as a profession.  Our virtual tutoring
  program breaks down walls between diverse LA communities and encourages people
  young and old from multiple ethnicities and races to connect. Older
  sibling-like relationships form that we expect to last a lifetime. Thanks to
  Zoom, tutors are provided with a literal window into the life realities in
  communities they have never seen, which is an effective means to break down
  systemic racism.
