Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Heart of Los Angeles (HOLA) provides underserved youth with free, exceptional
  after-school programs in academics, arts and athletics within a nurturing
  environment, empowering them to develop their potential, pursue their
  education and strengthen their communities.
project_description: >-
  Each year, HOLA’s Visual Arts Department provides intensive visual arts
  programming to 250+ youth with limited or no access to art at school. HOLA
  offers over 100 classes in 22 different art forms (ceramics, photography,
  painting, sculpture, illustration, printmaking and more). Students express
  themselves artistically, gain confidence, and build transferable skills. In
  response to the COVID-19 crisis, the department has implemented remote
  programming with individual phone calls, weekly instructional videos and
  take-home art kits. 
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >
  HOLA serves youth and families living in and around the Rampart District and
  Westlake area of Los Angeles. Of the families HOLA serves, 96% live in
  poverty, and all are impacted by the neighborhood's struggling economy and
  culture of violence, crime, gang activity, limited school resources and
  inequitable educational opportunities that put youth at risk, threaten their
  academic success and their ability to overcome poverty. Nearly 90% of the
  area’s youth are enrolled in LAUSD schools which are often underperforming and
  understaffed, and many of HOLA’s local feeder schools have seen a significant
  decline in access to quality arts education programs. The recent COVID-19
  crisis and subsequent closure of local schools has further exacerbated these
  problems: job loss among HOLA parents is widespread, and for youth already
  dealing with the crushing pressures of poverty, these events have a dramatic
  impact on learning, emotional wellbeing and physical health.
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >
  Over 30 years, HOLA has strived to give kids all they need to achieve their
  full potential through free, high-quality programs in a safe and nurturing
  environment. HOLA’s Visual Arts Department provides 250+ students with access
  to 100 annual art classes (ceramics, photography, painting, sculpture and
  more), workshops, public art projects and cultural field trips. Students have
  access to academic support services (tutoring, college prep courses,
  mentorship), college scholarships and alumni support services.
   
  In the COVID-19 crisis, HOLA is leveraging longstanding quality relationships
  with students and parents to ensure an adaption and continuation of services
  to meet emerging and emergency needs. Weekly, the Visual Arts team conducts
  check-in calls with each student and provides recorded how-to videos designed
  to minimize screen time and using at-hand supplies. The department will use
  social media to share students’ art and positive stories during this socially
  isolating period.
What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: >
  HOLA’s Visual Arts Department utilizes both quantitative and qualitative
  methods that include year-end surveys, evaluations, staff, peer and self
  reflections and feedback, and more. HOLA’s Visual Arts Department anticipates
  the following results:  

  Each year, HOLA’s Visual Arts Department will provide 250 youth with access to
  free quality arts education programs. 

  HOLA will provide youth with 100+ visual arts classes, public art projects,
  field trips, access to professional artists, access to academic and wraparound
  support services, and more.

  By the end of each year, 85% of surveyed art-focused students will agree that
  they have improved as artists.

  By the end of each year, 85% of surveyed art-focused students will agree that
  they can work together with others to make things better and strengthen their
  community.


  During this time that students are staying home, HOLA will measure the success
  of its existing online-based arts programming through the number of video
  views and weekly individual phone calls with youth and families. HOLA will
  consider the programming a success if students are able to successfully
  complete the art projects taught in the videos, continue to develop an
  appreciation for art and are eager to engage in HOLA’s Visual Arts programming
  upon their return to our campus. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '250'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  HOLA’s Visual Arts programming immerses underserved youth in cultural and arts
  education experiences they otherwise may not experience. Believing that art
  can be a powerful agent of social change and that education can provide
  empowerment, liberation and pride, HOLA’s Visual Arts staff works to instill a
  creative process in each student that will last a lifetime--skills that can
  provide strength during times of crisis such as now. HOLA staff focuses on
  exposing students to diverse, inclusive modes of artistic expression and
  prioritizes opportunities such as art rooted in indigenous culture. A recent
  evaluation showed that 96% of surveyed students felt they had improved as an
  artist after one year of program participation.

  - Access to the LA2050 community
