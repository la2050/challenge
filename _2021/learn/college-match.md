Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Provide high-achieving, low-income high school students in Los Angeles County
  the necessary tools and guidance to get into top-ranked colleges. We are
  dedicated to helping students find the best college match and giving them the
  support necessary to graduate with little student debt, leading to a
  successful and fulfilling future.
project_description: >-
  College Match LA is committed to helping talented Angeleno students achieve
  the American Dream through a college education. For over 18 years, our
  students have enrolled and graduated from the nation’s top colleges. The
  COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted low-income communities of color.
  In order to fulfill our commitment of a transformative college education we
  have committed to support our college scholars to find internships and gainful
  employment through our pilot program, Project Match.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - South Bay
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g., using a
  job recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing
  sites, applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college
  affordability to advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Finding a job after graduation is difficult and overwhelming for any student.
  The young people we work with are bright, hard working and attend top colleges
  but they lack family resources, and extended networks to fully engage in
  meaningful career exploration. There are knowledge gaps based on career
  options, fields, how to create a professional resume, how to prepare for
  interviews and how to network. These knowledge gaps can limit our students’
  opportunities for economic mobility and growth. Our students have received an
  excellent education but cannot share their experiences, perspective and ideas
  with employers. Los Angeles needs diverse talent to lead projects and
  initiatives that will improve our city and beyond. We need to prepare our
  future leaders who need extra support and resources to thrive.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The goal of Project Match is to support our students find internships and
  employment that are career oriented and allow for professional growth. The
  program is focused on three pillars: career exploration, connecting students
  with opportunities and career coaching. Career Exploration: Project Match will
  provide opportunities for career exploration through Career Thursdays. During
  these virtual panels, our career partners will join us to present and share
  internship opportunities, insight into booming new career fields, and
  professional insight around career exploration. Connections: First-generation
  students are far less likely to have well-connected friends, family members
  and business associates. By partnering with employer partners and
  professionals in diverse career fields, we will connect our students to
  networking opportunities that align with their goals and career endeavours.
  Students will gain mentors and connect with possible employers. Career
  Coaches: Our volunteer career coaches will be matched with our students to
  work on critical skill building that will prepare our students for this new
  economy. Our coaches will work with our students to build competitive resumes,
  LinkedIn profiles, elevator pitches and prepare them for interviews. Our
  coaches will get to know our students’ strengths, skills and goals and will be
  able to advocate for them to potential employers and connect our students to
  opportunities.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Project Match will measure success based on data gathered through a survey at
  the end of each cohort that will measure: Number of students who have found an
  internship or job Number of students who have secured jobs or prestigious
  fellowships upon graduation from their post- secondary education. The number
  of partner organizations that continue to hire our students and work with us.
  The number of partner organizations gained at the end of the year.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '720'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The original goal of College Match is to change the lives of thousands of
  exceptional low-income young adults, their families and communities in Los
  Angeles. Our students come from communities with high poverty, little social
  mobility and limited access to professional networks which are additional
  barriers to finding gainful employment and internship opportunities. Project
  Match will help our students find employment that offers them career growth,
  fair pay and benefits. If we are successful in this endeavor, our students
  will have more financial security and secure generational upward mobility.
  Project Match will prepare the future leaders of Los Angeles and ensure that
  employers, companies and organizations have diverse talent that reflect the
  city of Los Angeles. When they become professionals in their fields, they will
  be role models for other low-income young people of color and uplift their
  communities
