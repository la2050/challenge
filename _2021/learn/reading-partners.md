Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Reading Partners’ mission is to help children become lifelong readers by
  empowering communities to provide individualized instruction with measurable
  results, and we envision a future where all children will have the literacy
  skills they need to reach their full potential. 
project_description: >
  Reading Partners helps hundreds of economically disadvantaged  move toward
  reading proficiency by helping them develop mastery of key reading skills
  through data-informed, curriculum-driven, one-on-one volunteer tutoring. We
  strive to build sustainable, community-driven solutions to the literacy crisis
  and educational equity for all who live in the Greater Los Angeles Area. 


  Reading Partners plans to expand our core program in LA County and deepen
  local impact on fourth grade literacy achievement, reaching 1000 students by
  2022.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - South Bay
In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  According to the 2016 California Assessment of Student Performance and
  Progress Test (CAASPP), 72% of Los Angeles County’s economically disadvantaged
  student scored below reading standards in 2016. Research shows that children
  who do not master early literacy skills experience a decreased rate of reading
  skill acquisition, tending to fall further and faster behind in reading than
  their peers, a phenomenon called the Matthew Effect (Stanovich,1986). Being
  below grade-level proficiency after fourth grade is equivalent to being shut
  out of content learning in class (Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2011). Reading
  Partners targets low-income elementary students who have yet to master basic
  foundational reading skills and who are six months to two-and-a-half years
  behind grade level proficiency.
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >-
  Reading Partners believes reading is the foundation of all future learning,
  and is the only nationally scaled program in the country with the complete
  package of in-school, one-on-one literacy instruction by volunteers who are
  trained and supported by staff. In each school, Reading Partners transforms a
  dedicated space into a reading center and recruits at least 50 volunteer
  tutors to serve 40 or more students. Our student-tutor pairs work together for
  45 minutes twice per week, following an individualized reading plan tailored
  to each student’s particular needs and strengths as well as Reading Partners’
  strategic goals for student reading achievement. To execute this plan, tutors
  use Reading Partners’ curriculum, a series of research-based, structured
  lessons plans that progress from phonics instruction for early readers to
  comprehension strategy instruction for more advanced students. 
What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: >
  Reading Partners’ overarching goal is to help close the reading achievement
  gap among low-income youth by producing measurable improvement in students’
  reading skills. We track each student’s progress against their primary
  end-of-year literacy growth goal. We help our younger students—those in
  kindergarten through second-grade—make strides to develop mastery of
  foundational reading skills appropriate for their grade level and support our
  older students by ensuring they are on track to read at grade-level by the end
  of the year. Thus, we measure the success of our program each year against the
  following metrics:


  Objective 1:  83 percent of all Reading Partners’ students will meet or exceed
  their primary, individualized end-of-year literacy growth goal.

  Objective 2: 90 percent of all kindergarteners through second-graders will
  master grade-appropriate foundational literacy skills, putting them on track
  to read at or above grade level by third grade. 

  Objective 3: 75 percent of all third- and fourth-grade students will
  demonstrate growth in reading scores compared to a national group of peers in
  the same grade. 

  Objective 4: 70 percent of students will show improvement in general academic
  behaviors, such as class participation and regular homework completion, as
  reported by teacher surveys.

  Objective 5: 90 percent of teachers and principals will identify Reading
  Partners as a valuable asset to their school, as measured by surveys.

  Objective 6: 2-3 additional school partners will be identified for the 2021-22
  school year, where we will be able to reach the additional 150 students needed
  to reach 1000 students across the Greater Los Angeles Area.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '900'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '2500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Basic literacy is the foundation for future success, and a critical stepping
  stone helping low-income students break the cycle of poverty.  Educational
  attainment entrenches the cycle of poverty by diminishing future earning
  potential. When poverty is factored in, students who can't read at grade level
  by 4th grade are 13 times less likely to graduate high school compared to
  their more affluent peers. Young adults without a diploma earned a median
  income of $25,400 in 2015—half of the earnings of a young adult worker with a
  bachelor’s degree. Reading Partners’ overarching goal is to help close the
  achievement gap through equitable access to educational support that will set
  them on a path to lifelong learning and future success. 
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Communications support
  - 'Office space for meetings, events, or for staff'
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: ''
Which metrics will you impact?:
  - High school graduation rates
  - Student proficiency in English & Language Arts
Indicate any additional LA2050 goals your application will impact.: []
Has your proposal changed due to COVID-19?: >
  School closures resulting from COVID-19 have a significant impact on all students; however, for low-income communities, that impact is devastating. Students who were already falling will fall even further behind.


  Over the past 3 months, we have provided bilingual content-rich virtual resources to families via online platforms and text, individualized literacy skill videos and guidance directly to our families and schools, and hosted biweekly live story time for our students.


  Looking forward to the 2021 school year, we are preparing for several scenarios that allow us to continue to adapt to the needs of our school partners and students. While all of our school partners have requested onsite presence of Reading Partners staff and as much traditional one-on-one in-person tutoring support as possible, we know it is critical that we also have remote, individualized tutoring available to our students, so that we can continue to provide the critical support needed regardless of our ever-changing safety needs of our schools.


  So, in addition to the continuation of the above resources in the upcoming school year, Reading Partners will also be offering remote tutoring that will extend our proven curriculum into a virtual environment. We are currently building a platform for our students to experience our curriculum virtually with a volunteer tutor, either at home or at school. We plan to roll out the program fully in the fall along with some of our other summer pilot programs.
