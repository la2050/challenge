  “Together We Succeed” (TWS) will empower Latinx and other underrepresented in
  medicine pre-health professions community college students to excel in their
  transition to a four-year undergraduate program. TWS will provide mentorship
  from pre-health professions students and health professionals from similar
  backgrounds and paths to build a community of support. TWS students will gain
  the knowledge, skills, behaviors and networks that will propel them on an
  actionable path to applying successfully to health professions schools.

  “Together We Succeed” (TWS, por sus siglas en inglés)/“Juntos triunfamos” dará la fuerza a los latinos y a los estudiantes subrepresentados en las profesiones médicas para triunfar en su transición de colegio comunitario a un programa universitario de cuatro años. “Juntos triunfamos” proporcionará tutoría de estudiantes y profesionales de la salud con orígenes similares, para construir una comunidad de apoyo. Los estudiantes obtendrán el conocimiento, las habilidades, los comportamientos y los contactos para impulsarlos hacia adelante en un camino para matricularse con éxito en las escuelas profesionales de la salud.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA

  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Latinx’s comprise over 40% of California’s population, yet only 5% of the
  overall physician population and 12% of graduating physicians in the state. At
  this rate, it will take 500 years for the proportion of Latinx physicians to
  match their proportion in the population. Similar disparities exist for
  Black/African American populations in California. The lack of diversity in the
  physician workforce contributes to worse outcomes for patients and perceived
  lesser quality of care. Over one-third of Latinx students who attend college
  start at a community college. In the Los Angeles County Community College
  District which comprises nine colleges and 229,793 students, 72.3% of the
  students are from underrepresented in medicine (UIM) backgrounds. In order to
  effectively address the lack of physician workforce diversity, it is critical
  to properly engage and mentor Latinx and other UIM students while they are at
  community colleges.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  “Together We Succeed” (TWS) will be modeled after our existing “Medical School
  Readiness” series, a longitudinal 12 month program with monthly workshops,
  small group sessions, and longitudinal one-on-one mentorship to successfully
  assist underrepresented in medicine (UIM) students to navigate the medical
  school application process. Similarly, TWS will empower UIM community college
  (cc) students aspiring to a health professions career with the confidence,
  knowledge, skills and behaviors needed to successfully transition to a
  four-year institution. TWS will provide UIM speakers to instruct on how to
  navigate the transition to a four-year institution. TWS will also provide a
  community of support that can validate the experiences of students who are
  first-generation college-goers or DACA students with mentors who have
  successfully navigated similar paths. Lastly, TWS will provide small group
  sessions and one on one mentorship to support students in their journeys. TWS
  students will develop an actionable plan that aligns with their personal
  mission. TWS students will eventually rely on the broader MiMentor community
  for support and further leadership development and personal growth.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  TWS will be modeled after MiMentor’s MSR program, which has existed for five
  years. Our MSR team collects extensive demographic data on our participants,
  pre-and post-surveys on their confidence, level of support, written, verbal
  skills development as well as qualitative feedback on personal and
  pre-professional development and leadership skills. We also collect
  quantitative data on applications submitted to medical school, interviews and
  admissions offered. An abstract presented on MSR in 2017 at UCLA showed
  significant unadjusted bivariate self-reported outcomes on pre- and
  post-surveys as well as an acceptance rate to medical school of 55%, 10% above
  the overall national acceptance rate. A more recent analysis of our 2018-2019
  cohort revealed an acceptance rate of over 90% for those who applied. We are
  confident that utilizing similar teams, operations and culturally relevant
  curriculum will allow us to implement similar analytical tools and achieve
  positive outcomes for TWS.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '150'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '750'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Together We Succeed would help fill a needed gap in mentorship and leadership
  development for those pre-health professional Latinx and other UIM students
  attending Los Angeles Community College District, where a majority of Latinx
  and Black college-going students reside. TWS would help increase the success
  of these students in their transition to four-year institutions by increasing
  transfer rates, academic success and eventual four-year institution graduation
  rates. TWS would also increase these students’ awareness of viable pathways to
  health professional careers as well as their pursuit and persistence in those
  pathways. Finally, TWS would increase the leadership skills of community
  college pre-health professional students so that they can contribute not only
  by mentoring other students, but also by participating in relevant pre-health
  professional activities in their respective Los Angeles County communities
  where they can make an immediate impact.
