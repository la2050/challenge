Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  The mission of Access Books is to provide high interest reading material to
  underserved children in Los Angeles by providing low income neighborhoods with
  a warm and welcoming school or community library. In this process, different
  communities work together around the love of books. 
project_description: >
  We transform dilapidated school libraries in L.A. Since 1999, Access Books has
  donated well over 1.7 million books to over 300 school and community
  libraries. We serve schools with a high population of children receiving Title
  I funds in underserved communities such as Watts, South Central, Compton,
  parts of the Valley, downtown and East Los Angeles. We donate thousands of
  books and paint literacy themed murals for each school as well as donate
  reading furniture and rugs.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Access Books addresses the urgent need for inner city and underserved children
  to have access to plentiful reading material. Research indicates that the best
  predictor of reading ability is access to books, and in poverty neighborhoods,
  the quality of the school library is the primary resource for foretelling
  reading ability and achievement. For decades in California, school library
  funding has been ignored, resulting in neglected and pitiful libraries. Many
  schools have books that are outdated (books from the mid- 20th century with
  Caucasian characters only), tattered and dull.  Many children in low income
  areas do not own books in the home and the public library may be too dangerous
  to get to alone (or closed on a Sunday when they could go with their
  families.)  Access to books must come from their school libraries. In order
  for children to do well in school, they must read well and to read well they
  must read a lot.
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >-
  Access Books fundraises to buy plenty of brand new, hard cover, high quality,
  culturally relevant, popular books that students want to read. We match
  community groups together to transform libraries on Saturdays. An affluent
  school does a book drive for a recipient school and together both communities
  work side by side shelving books and painting murals. People of all ages are
  brought together around the love of books. 


  By making sure that children in low income neighborhoods have plenty to read,
  we're helping them become better readers. And when children read well, they do
  better in school. 
What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: >-
  We measure success by how many times our books get checked out, how many books
  total get checked out, how children feel about reading, and how their
  performance in school improves. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '20000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '2000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The broader goal is to support childhood literacy in Los Angeles so that all
  children, regardless of their socio-economic status, can do well in school,
  graduate, compete for higher paying jobs, go on to college, and become leaders
  in their communities
