Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  For the past ten years, Crayon Collection has recycled like new crayons from
  restaurants and hotels into Title 1 Schools and Head Start centers across Los
  Angeles in order to provide art education and promote sustainability in Los
  Angeles’ most underserved schools. 
project_description: >-
  Our Arts in Education program provides free, artist inspired lesson plans
  formatted by volunteer educators to teach common core standards. Art in
  education has been shown to help with comprehension of STEM and literacy
  concepts and offers students an outlet to process trauma and develop
  self-discipline, self-management, and interpersonal relationship skills. For
  kids in underfunded communities with limited resources, we use art to
  facilitate student growth, increasing the chances of participants graduating
  and pursuing further education.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - South Bay
  - Antelope Valley
  - >-
    LAUSD (please select only if you have a district-wide partnership or
    project)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Across the United States, and specifically in Los Angeles, schools are faced
  with slashed budgets and limited resources. Often, these cuts lead to the loss
  of arts education in entire schools, despite research showing that high arts
  engagement in elementary school increases the chances of low-income students
  graduating high school and makes them three times more likely to receive a
  bachelor’s degree. By providing these materials and lessons, our program helps
  to close gaps left by budget cuts, promoting social, economic and racial
  equity in the communities we serve and helping to ensure students’ future
  success. Additionally, each year the average teacher spends over $900 a year
  on supplies. Working with our partner artists, we regularly support teachers
  through classroom visits which provide us the opportunity to teach our lesson
  plans and donate an entire classroom supply of crayons to teachers and
  students in need. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Crayon Collection has been working in Title 1 schools and Head Start centers
  in Los Angeles for ten years, supplying lesson plans and art supplies to
  classrooms most in need. In 2018, we set a Guinness World Record for the most
  crayons donated in 8 hours when we donated over 1 million crayons and our Arts
  in Education lessons to over 700 LAUSD teachers. We currently work directly
  with 20+ Title 1 schools and Head Start centers across Los Angeles to provide
  recycled crayons and art-based education to over 2,000 students. Additionally,
  relationships with professional artists and educators put us in a unique
  position to create new, art-based lesson plans for our curriculum, given the
  funding to do so. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Crayon Collection would like to expand and redevelop parts of our Art in
  Education curriculum to provide 30 lesson plans total, enough for educators to
  be able to use one a week for the duration of the school year. We currently
  serve approximately 2,000 underserved students in Los Angeles a year and would
  like to double this number in the next twelve months. A study conducted by the
  National Endowment for the Arts found that students from low-income
  communities who had high engagement with the arts were 5x more likely to
  graduate high school and 3x more likely to receive a bachelor’s degree. Short
  term, we should find improved academic performance which will be tracked
  through participant/classroom’s grades over the school year. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '150'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '2500'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  In California, 61% of schools are lacking even one full-time arts specialist,
  with low-income areas having the least funding for arts-based curriculum.
  Research by the National Endowment for the Arts has shown that high levels of
  art based education in low-income areas raises the average GPA by .22 and
  increased the percentage of 12th graders who planned to earn a Bachelors from
  42 to 61%. Investing in programs like Crayon Collection’s Arts in Education
  program helps to close gaps left by limited funding directly increasing a
  student’s future chances of success. 
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
