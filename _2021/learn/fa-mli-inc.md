project_description: >-
  The See A Man Be A Man program is a place on Locke College Preparatory
  Academy’s campus where young men come together to realize and develop their
  leadership abilities. We surround students with powerful mentors and role
  models to learn from, and our 9-point program guides students to grow
  holistically. As we expand our program to include young women, we are
  improving the curriculum to cover college goals, career, health, culture,
  spirituality, and more. 
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >
  FA-MLI’s services resonate naturally with our students as their lives

  are often filled with traumatic, life-altering events that inform their
  social/academic/personal behavior. Many of our students have witnessed the
  murders of loved ones and live with the trauma of sexual molestation, drug
  abuse, alcoholism, verbal assault, systemic racism, and educational
  maltreatment. Ninety percent of our students have no father or viable male
  role model in their lives, and sixty five percent live with a single mother or
  grandmother. 


  Our services are culturally authentic and instructors share a similar
  social/racial/ background as students comfortably relate to them. Our unique
  mentoring and school based art programs follow a nine-point curriculum, which
  teaches youth to accept personal responsibility for their lives. Embedded in
  the curriculum are the development of life skills (i.e. anger management),
  preparing for job interviews, civic engagement, cultural literacy, and much
  more. 
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >-
  Due to the increase in low graduation rates, substance abuse, teenage
  pregnancies, gang involvement and death related shootings affecting African
  Americans and Hispanics between the ages of 12 to 30, FA-MLI Inc. is dedicated
  to targeting underrepresented demographics.  


  Our commitment is to advance social and economic equity in under-resourced
  communities by developing projects and programs dedicated to transforming the
  lives of at-risk (at-promise) youth and communities in Los Angeles, focusing
  on Watts, Compton, South L.A. and Inglewood. Starting with our program at
  Locke High, we directly serve the residents of Nickerson Gardens - the largest
  public housing project west of the Mississippi River, and the birthplace of
  the Crips and the Bloods.


  FA-MLI is proud to announce that for the past five years, its program efforts
  have graduated 100 percent of the youth who arrived to the 12th grade, with
  80% enrolling in college and 20% enlisting in the United States Military. 
What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: >-
  The program staff will collect data to determine whether activities outlined
  in the program outcomes are being implemented as planned. This will include
  attendance of students at each activity, session, workshops, field trips, and
  other program related events. Demographic information of students will be
  collected as well as surveys including questions and opinions on program
  success, as well as areas that need improvement. Once students enroll in the
  programs, they will be administered surveys with questions on career goals,
  college plans, and students outlook on life without a crime record. 


  The same survey will be administered to students on a quarterly basis to
  determine if the program produced its intended effect on students life without
  crime. Results from the surveys will be shared as a Progress Report with
  Program staff and any My LA2050200 appointed evaluator.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '325'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '4500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our program reduces the number of youth involved in the justice system by
  preventing them from going in to begin with. At Locke High, we engage with
  campus security and administrators in an effort to provide alternative methods
  of discipline that diverts kids away from the juvenile justice system by
  offering crisis counseling, parent-engagement, home visits, and reflective
  writing assignments and mindfulness that addresses the root causes of crime
  and victimization.


  This is a way of thinking systemically and holistically about the complex,
  multiple interconnected roots of social problems in our neighborhoods. It
  calls for collaborative, comprehensive and sustained efforts to transform
  these underlying conditions through participation. 
'Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.': >
  One Voice works now as a partner serving our students, as they look for
  guidance selecting a college, community college, or trade school upon high
  school graduation. Their Scholars Program prepares and supports 150 low-income
  students from Los Angeles for college success through professional college
  advisement, personal counseling, college essay instruction, SAT preparation
  courses, application and testing fees, emergency funds, and “wraparound”
  services available to each Scholar and each Scholars’ family. to graduate from
  college. 


  As a testament to their commitment, 100% of their Scholars are admitted to
  four-year colleges, 95% graduate from college, and over 30% go on to graduate
  school.
