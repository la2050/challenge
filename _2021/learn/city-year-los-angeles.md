Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Our mission is to build democracy through citizen service, civic leadership
  and social entrepreneurship. We leverage the service of our AmeriCorps members
  to address the inequitable distribution of educational resources across Los
  Angeles, which we believe strengthens our democracy and develops civic leaders
  and social entrepreneurs. 
project_description: >-
  City Year believes all children can succeed. Every day, our AmeriCorps members
  serve as student success coaches, helping students build on their strengths
  and cultivate social, emotional and academic skills - from mastering fractions
  to learning to work in teams. City Year partners with schools in
  under-resourced communities to create learning environments where all students
  have the tools to grow and fully engage in their education.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Students in the communities we serve often don’t have access to educational
  opportunities and tend to face systemic obstacles that can further drain their
  capacity to learn. Students in these circumstances graduate high school at
  rates that are nearly 22 percentage points lower than their middle- and
  upper-income peers. This inequity is due in part to a lack of access to
  educational opportunities and individualized supports that are designed to
  meet the intensity of student need. Current school closures and distance
  learning undoubtedly create more barriers that can compromise students’
  academic and life outcomes. According to the NWEA, students will likely see
  learning loss similar to that of other disruptive crises or to the “summer
  slide” crises. This learning loss is likely to be exacerbated by the
  additional aspects of trauma students are experiencing, particularly the
  students we serve who come from households impacted the most economically. 
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  As Los Angeles and Inglewood Unified Schools Districts operate via remote
  virtual learning, our AmeriCorps members continue to serve as student success
  coaches in a virtual capacity. We focus on the three types of interventions
  known as “Early Warning Indicators” of being off-track from graduation for
  students – attendance, behavior, and course performance.    We have pivoted
  our service to adapt to the ever-changing needs of our schools and students.
  City Year Los Angeles has developed a variety of options to implement our
  course performance and social-emotional development interventions virtually or
  in a hybrid remote/in-person capacity, when the time comes. Our AmeriCorps
  members lead breakout rooms to review specific academic concepts with small
  groups of students, call home to promote attendance or assist with
  technological issues, host virtual afterschool spaces where they can help with
  homework and class material, set goals with students around social-emotional
  competencies, and perform regular check-ins with students to monitor their
  growth in those areas, among a myriad of other supports. AmeriCorps members’
  invaluable presence in virtual classrooms will help to mitigate learning
  loss.  This grant award will help us maintain a strong cohort of AmeriCorps
  members who work hard to decrease the potentially widening skill gaps of our
  students, help create differentiation in the virtual and in person
  environments, and to assist teachers in virtual settings. 
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We will continue to evaluate our impact via qualitative feedback from our
  partner schools. We elicit this feedback from our partner teachers and
  principals regarding our impact on students via mid-year and end of year
  surveys. Through the surveys, teachers and principals can assess their
  satisfaction with City Year and evaluate the impact of our service on students
  and school culture.  This year, we have our highest ever approval ratings from
  our partner teachers! 95% believe that CYLA AmeriCorps members are having a
  positive impact with students.  During a typical school year, we would measure
  our academic impact by using the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH) Inventory
  exams and the Deveraux Student Strengths Assessment (DESSA) to measure
  students’ academic and social-emotional development. This year, we will not
  administer the HMH inventory or DESSA, as those tests have not been built for
  the virtual space and as AmeriCorps members must be physically present when
  the tests are taken.  
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '13000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  If our work is successful, our students will be better equipped academically
  and social-emotionally to return to in-person learning.   Prior to the
  pandemic, City Year was the subject of a study with the Everyone Graduates
  Center at Johns Hopkins University to explore whether there is a connection
  between social-emotional and academic outcomes and understand whether there is
  a correlation between time with an AmeriCorps member (ACM) and student
  outcomes.  The study found a strong connection between social-emotional
  development and academic outcomes. According to the study, improving in just
  one area of social-emotional development is equivalent to gaining a year of
  schooling. This analysis validated City Year’s holistic approach by revealing
  that we support improvements in academic outcomes through the direct effect of
  English Language Arts or math tutoring time with an ACM, and through
  social-emotional support from an ACM, which correlated with stronger academic
  outcomes.
