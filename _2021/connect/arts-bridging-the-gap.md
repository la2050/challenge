  100 Murals for Peace will bring a county-wide, united, colorful message of
  peace to the world from the youth and communities of Los Angeles. 100 unique
  art pieces designed by students and young artists will be selected from a
  county-wide contest. On September 11-13, 2020 thousands of volunteers from
  community groups, schools, workplaces, veterans organizations, and more will
  paint their adopted mural on one of 100 walls across the city, spreading
  peace, joy and togetherness through this collective creative action.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >
  Arts Bridging the Gap’s 100 Murals for Peace Project will serve youth in
  under- resourced communities, many of whom have experienced childhood trauma.
  Over 90% of our participants live well under the poverty line. The majority
  are undocumented or have close family members who are undocumented, and many
  have unstable housing. Studies show that murals significantly reduce the crime
  rate up to 18%  and elevate residents’ sense of community and satisfaction
  with their city (“The Effect of Mural on Personal Crime and Fear of Crime” in
  Procedia: Social and Behavorial Sciences, 2016). Our experience shows, time
  and time again, that when kids become involved in the design and creation of a
  mural in their community, they develop a vested interest in using and
  maintaining their communal spaces. When they have a true creative connection
  to the places they frequent, the community becomes a better and safer place to
  live, work, and visit. Now imagine the power of painting 100 murals in three
  days!
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >
  Arts Bridging the Gap is the only organization of its kind not only in Los
  Angeles, but across the nation that creates community connections and artistic
  opportunities for thousands of youth living in poverty while at the same time
  engaging an empathy curriculum that responds to the effects and implications
  of childhood trauma. We use positive psychology and trauma-informed care
  within our arts-based project to heal toxic stress in an open, vulnerable
  collaborative format.


  While many other organizations provide arts programming to youth in
  under-resourced communities, the sheer scale of the 100 Murals for Peace
  project is unmatched. Ours is also the only organization that provides such a
  high number of students the opportunity to have their artwork displayed in a
  permanent location in their community. We’re able to commit to such a
  large-scale project in such a short period of time thanks to our wide network
  of artists, supporters, volunteers, partners, and friends. 
What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: >
  One of our initial gauges of success will be the number of people involved in
  developing this project. Through press and partnerships, we will encourage
  thousands of kids across LA to contribute to the design process by getting
  their creative juices flowing and inviting them to put together a proposal of
  what “peace” means to them. Some young artists will be paired or partnered
  with our adult volunteers and partners, such as veterans groups, volunteer
  organizations, schools, and neighborhood groups like Team Rubicon and Big
  Sunday to help strengthen the message of peace and encourage the collaborative
  projects that are at the core of our mission. We will also define our success
  in the planning stages by how many community members and property owners are
  moved to donate their walls to our huge city-wide vision, as well as
  contributions of supplies. 


  In the execution phase of the project, a crucial measure of success will be
  the number of volunteers we get energized to spend a day wielding a brush,
  climbing a ladder, and supporting a group of peers in the creation of a larger
  than life painting! Ultimately, the biggest measure of success won’t be, “did
  we get 100 murals painted?” But rather, “did we have fun and learn more about
  each other in the process of doing it? And does our neighborhood look and feel
  like a stronger community as a result?” If the answer to these questions is a
  resounding “yes!”, then we achieved what we set out to do.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '6650'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '3800000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: ' A mural has immensely positive impacts on its surroundings. It creates pride in a community both for those who create it and who look upon it, increases foot traffic, and attracts businesses and tourists to an area. A mural turns a drab street corner into a hub where people gather, and often becomes a phenom on social media - think, for instance, of how often murals are used as the backdrops for selfies and videos. Studies show that the placement of a mural can attract housing creation, reduce depression and crime, and overall elevate the quality of life for residents and businesses. At Arts Bridging the Gap, that is fundamentally what we exist to do - uplift and create connections and messages of peace within, for and by our city.'
