Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  The mission of Students Run LA is to challenge underserved secondary students
  to experience the benefits of goal-setting, character development, adult
  mentoring and improved health by providing them with a truly life-changing
  experience: The training for and completion of the Los Angeles Marathon.
project_description: >-
  The Civics Center (TCC) and Students Run LA (SRLA) will increase voter
  awareness, registration, and turnout in LA County by leveraging their
  networks, volunteers, expertise, and resources to expand outreach to
  highschool students, their teachers and families in predominantly
  underrepresented Latinx communities. TCC will work with SRLA to create
  student-led voter registration (VR) drives at SRLA races and SRLA high schools
  in majority Latinx and other diverse communities to promote civic
  volunteerism, responsibility and democratic participation.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    LAUSD (please select only if you have a district-wide partnership or
    project)
In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Strong voter participation is essential to a strong democracy, yet only a
  small fraction of young Angelenos have turned out to vote in recent years. As
  of February 2020, less than 15% of eligible 16 & 17 year olds in LA County
  were pre-registered to vote. Once registered, students are more likely to vote
  and become informed participants in our democracy. Young Latinx voters are one
  of the fastest growing segments of the electorate but had some of the lowest
  voter turnout rates in CA in 2018 per the California Civic Engagement Project.
  TCC, through its student-led VR drives and volunteers, makes it easy and
  engaging for students to register. Peer-to-peer outreach, instead of a
  top-down approach, gets better results and also drives TCC’s partnership with
  SRLA that has built an active, engaged community of youth. TCC seeks to tap
  into SRLA’s network and to provide resources needed for students to run VR
  drives in majority Latinx schools to encourage youth participation in our
  democracy.
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >-
  The TCC x SRLA partnership will improve LA County youth voter registration and
  turnout rates by engaging diverse student bodies. TCC uses an effective VR
  model augmented by the latest technologies that has proven to be efficient and
  effective. Webinars facilitate the training of student leaders, who in turn
  engage their peers to register, and text banking encourages election day
  turnout. Altogether, this outreach encourages students to participate across a
  geographically dispersed area like LA County.


  SRLA’s engaged community of students and teachers is the critical bridge to
  reaching students, along with their families, in schools in underserved
  neighborhoods. SRLA has strong relationships in this community and a warm
  introduction from a trusted partner is valuable, especially in connecting with
  a Latinx electorate that has historically had low voter participation rates.
  Once trained, SRLA students can return to their schools to lead VR drives,
  creating a powerful multiplier effect.
What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: >-
  The program’s overarching goal is to increase participation in democratic
  institutions by a largely underrepresented electorate - Latinx youth in LA
  County. By encouraging this engagement, we seek to build an active,
  civically-minded electorate among the greater Latinx community in historically
  underrepresented neighborhoods. 


  Short-term, we seek to grow awareness and participation among Latinx youth.
  Youth younger than 16 will learn that they can pre-register to vote when they
  come of age. Youth between 16 and 18 will pre-register to vote while youth who
  are 18 and older will register to vote. For those old enough to vote on
  election day, we will also encourage participation in the 2020 election. By
  expanding voter registration in young voters, we expect that this engagement
  will further encourage others, especially older family members, to register
  and participate in elections.


  Our metrics for success:

  1) Across 3 SRLA events, TCC will: a) Conduct 150 conversations with students
  and educators about holding voter registration drives at their schools;  b)
  Collect 300 total voter registrations and preregistrations


  2) 20 School Leaders will be identified and trained to hold voter
  registrations


  3) 8 SRLA schools will hold voter registration drives, resulting in a) 1,500
  total registrations and preregistrations; b)  800 phone numbers collected


  4) GOTV texts sent to all 800 (or more) collected phone numbers


  5) 50% pre/registration rate for SRLA high school seniors reported in year-end
  survey, compared to 15% avg. preregistration rate for LA County
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '5000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '35000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Each year, SRLA’s program includes more than 2,000 high school students (86%
  Latinx; 75% attend schools where 80% or more receive free/reduced meals; 75%
  of graduating seniors are among the first-generation of their families to go
  to college) at 100 high schools and community programs across Greater Los
  Angeles to train alongside their 550+ teachers to COMPLETE the entire Los
  Angeles Marathon. Partnering with TCC, SRLA seeks to empower students to hold
  VR drives in their high schools where they discuss their values, build their
  capacity to make change, and register themselves and their friends to vote.
  Together, we can transform youth voting culture from one of apathy to
  inspired, active engagement this year and for years to come.
'Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.': >-
  In addition to training for the Marathon, students participate in SRLA Cares,
  an initiative that empowers them to give back to their community through
  social, environmental, and community awareness projects. Each group is
  encouraged to engage their classmates to maximize their efforts in food
  drives, holiday toy collections, energy education, and more.


  With this infrastructure in place, students have a platform to learn about
  another way to support their community - voting. As a partner, TCC brings the
  necessary training and support for students. By collaborating with SRLA,
  students are introduced to TCC through an organization they trust. TCC can
  then work with this historically difficult to engage population, ultimately
  supporting LA2050's civic engagement goal.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
