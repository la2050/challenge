Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Refugees come to the U.S. seeking a safe haven from violence and persecution,
  leaving behind family, friends, and virtually everything they own. Miry's List
  provides a network for Americans to directly help their resettling refugee
  neighbors get what they need to start their new lives.
project_description: >-
  Building welcoming connections between Angelenos and their resettling
  neighbors has an essential and transformative impact on our community.
  Building off our initial success, Welcome, Neighbor 2020 provides Angelenos
  with interactive opportunities to learn about refugee resettlement in our
  city. Participants have opportunities to connect with new arrival families,
  volunteer virtually and in-person, and develop personal connections as
  neighbors.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Refugee families often arrive in the U.S. without the network needed for a
  successful life. In 2020, the U.S. will admit up to 18,000 refugees. Despite
  lower admissions than previous years, Southern CA is a top destination for
  these families. Further, 11 of 28 resettlement agencies in CA closed in the
  last 3 years, severely limiting remaining agencies’ abilities to respond to
  families’ needs. 


  In 2018, Miry’s List launched Welcome, Neighbor, and engaged 40,000 Angelenos
  and 14 neighborhood councils to support resettling families. Last December,
  City Council declared LA an official Welcoming City for refugees. Welcome,
  Neighbor familiarized Angelenos with the refugee experience, giving
  touchpoints for interaction with new arrivals. 82% of 64 participants surveyed
  responded they “loved the experience” and want more. Welcome, Neighbor 2020
  builds off these touchpoints, providing infrastructure for ongoing human
  connection and meaningful volunteering in support of resettling Angelenos.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  The vital community support that begins through Miry’s List is a milestone for
  resettling families, moving them from a “refugee experience” to a
  “resettlement experience.” We’re a hub for new arrivals and Angelenos.
  Resettling families are referred by previous program recipients. Angelenos
  wanting to make an immediate positive impact do so through our events and
  website.


  Mr. Amiri, 75, from Afghanistan, who resettled in LA with his wife and 2
  children in Jan. 2020, said, “I cherish the presence of Miry's List for new
  arrivals. Miry's List made us feel at home in LA, that we have everything and
  everyone in the U.S.”


  Welcome, Neighbor provides accessible, fun, equitable space for Angelenos of
  all ages, abilities and backgrounds to develop meaningful connections as
  neighbors. The community-driven spirit of Welcome, Neighbor reflects deeply
  shared values. Our breadth of prior engagement demonstrates both ample
  interest in and readiness for an expanded Welcome, Neighbor programming in LA.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our vision for success is that the new arrival families touched by Welcome,
  Neighbor will feel safe, secure, and welcome in their new communities. We hope
  they’ll be integrated into the fabric of their neighborhoods, get to know
  their neighbors, and have a deepened understanding of LA values, thereby
  increasing their chances for a successful life in our community.


  We also want to provide Angelenos with a greater understanding of the refugee
  resettlement system in the U.S., how it feels to resettle as a refugee in Los
  Angeles, and how to help our resettling neighbors, thereby creating a more
  welcoming community where we all belong.

  We aim to engage 5,000 individuals in sustained, tangible, ongoing actions in
  service to resettling families in LA. These include: 


  - Volunteering as a family advocate, welcoming liaison, or listmaker for
  Miry’s List wishlist program;

  - Participating in community meal events and trainings;

  - Giving a housewarming gift to a resettling neighbor through a wishlist;

  - Providing social and emotional support virtually and in-person for a newly
  resettled family.


  This participation will result in at least 5 large-scale events (at least 100
  participants each), and 10 smaller-scale convenings (at least 75 participants
  each). We also aim to engage in 10 additional activations that are not
  considered events (i.e. Welcome, Neighbor days at schools where we educate
  students about the refugee experience, wishlist drives and collections, and
  community service projects).
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '5000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '50000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Angelenos care deeply about immigrants and refugees, evident by our civic
  leaders’ commitment and public enthusiasm for Welcome, Neighbor. When we
  support families resettling in our city as refugees, we give them hope for the
  future and strengthen our city as a whole. Welcome, Neighbor 2020 establishes
  a solid community-based infrastructure for sustained, meaningful connections
  between Angelenos and their resettling neighbors. Angelenos previously
  unfamiliar with the struggles of new arrivals have the opportunity to learn
  from the lived experience of their resettling neighbors. Personal connections
  established between new arrivals and longtime residents, over similarities and
  differences, create a lasting, multi-generational ripple effect.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - 'Office space for meetings, events, or for staff'
