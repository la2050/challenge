  ChaiVillageLA will expand our volunteer-driven multigenerational program
  successes by hiring a volunteer coordinator and developing a robust
  Multigenerational Program Volunteer Corps (MPVC). The volunteer coordinator
  will increase our capacity to engage active older adults in multigenerational
  volunteering with civic, cultural arts, educational and social justice
  community organizations. The volunteer coordinator will oversee volunteer
  training, engagement outreach, recognition, leadership development and
  evaluation components.

'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  We are addressing social isolation and loneliness among active older adults,
  exacerbated by older adults’ limited interaction with people of other
  generations and a lack of sense of purpose. Data indicates that volunteering
  later in life is associated with health benefits
  (https://direct.mit.edu/daed/article/144/2/55/27054/Productivity-amp-Engagement-in-an-Aging-America)
  and an increased sense of purpose
  (https://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Abstract/2016/02000/Purpose_in_Life_and_Its_Relationship_to_All_Cause.2.aspx).
  Research shows that intergenerational connection is also an important strategy
  for overcoming isolation. When generations come together, there are positive
  outcomes on physical & mental health. Multigenerational volunteer programs
  combat social isolation and loneliness by giving participants a sense of
  belonging in their communities.

'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  This year we successfully launched 6 multigenerational programs that involved
  50 older adults, a comparable number of younger participants and 6 different
  organizational partners. We were able to demonstrate positive impact while
  offering virtual programs in accordance with LA County Public Health
  guidelines. We intend to expand our capacity to engage more volunteers and
  partners for our multigenerational programs. To achieve this, we plan to hire
  a full-time volunteer coordinator who will support ChaiVillageLA’s existing
  volunteer Multigenerational Project Team to develop volunteer training,
  engagement outreach, recognition programs, leadership development and
  evaluation. With the guidance of a volunteer coordinator we will be able to
  engage more members in multigenerational programming, thereby reducing social
  isolation and loneliness and increasing participants’ sense of purpose.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  ChaiVillageLA launched 6 multigenerational programs this year. Each program
  joined members of the Village and a cohort of “youngers,” including teen boys
  doing community service for vandalism, UCLA Freshman Aging students, young
  professionals in a theatre arts fellowship, and young adults from a writing
  group. We selected evaluation tools based on each program’s goals from
  Generation United’s Intergenerational Evaluation Toolkit. Early findings from
  programs as short as 10 hours showed that positive relationships formed.
  “Youngers” were amazed at their commonality with the “olders,” and felt
  validated by the “olders’” investment in them. Both older and younger
  participants gained the confidence to reach out to more people and connect,
  which was especially encouraging during a pandemic when isolation has been so
  high. One “older” stated that she “was happy to learn that they [older adults]
  could be useful to teens and that the kids appreciated the time they spent
  with them.”
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '200'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  If all organizations in Los Angeles County included older adults on their
  boards and staffs, and in their volunteer pools, Los Angeles County would be
  enriched by the vast accumulation of talent and experience. We would no longer
  be wasting human capital. We would have a stronger sense of community across
  age groups. Health would improve and social isolation and loneliness would
  decrease among older adults and younger people. This vision is supported by
  the findings of the Purposeful Aging Los Angeles (PALA) survey, which
  recommends expanding older adult volunteer opportunities, resources and
  intergenerational social interactions (https://www.purposefulagingla.com/).
  Program’s Vision of Success: 100 older adults and 100 “youngers” participate
  in our programs and report reduced social isolation and loneliness and
  increased sense of purpose. Volunteers increase their level of responsibility
  over time, resulting in ongoing volunteer leadership succession.
