Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  MoceanLab serves as the model for engaging in empathetic and open
  collaboration with diverse stakeholders to design creative, future-focused,
  and inspirational human-centered solution. MoceanLab is dedicated to provide
  opportunities to explore equitable access to a variety of clean, reliable, and
  safe mobility solutions in all aspects of life.
project_description: >-
  MoceanLab will make low-emissions hybrid carshare vehicles available to
  healthcare providers at a 50-100% discount. This service will allow these
  frontline workers access to safe, reliable mobility that enable them to get to
  and from their places of work safely and efficiently. With more access to
  healthcare providers, our community will more effectively be able to access
  healthcare and mental health services, while the hybrid vehicles will help
  improve overall air quality.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Access to equitable transportation is an issue that faces many low income
  households in the Los Angeles area. Our pilot program would allow those who
  qualify LA Metro’s reduced fair access to reliable environmentally friendly
  transportation to commute around Los Angeles. Mocean Carshare will provide
  substantial discounts of our daily rate to those who qualify.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  We have a two-part pilot for our pilot program: Expand Networks of
  Transportation Options • Westside Carshare: Expand the current Mocean Carshare
  service to Del Rey and Venice and/or Warner Center. Mocean Carshare will add a
  discounted rate for low-income households which qualify for LA Metro’s reduced
  fare • On-Campus Carshare: Partner with local universities (e.g., UCLA, USC,
  Occidental, LMU, etc.) to establish a dedicated carshare service for their
  community that can serve faculty, staff, and students
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Transportation Access: Our success will be measured by the amount of approved
  driver and percentage of utilization.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '127600'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our pilot program aims to successfully improve Los Angeles traffic congestion
  and the corresponding environmental impact of having many vehicles on the
  road. Studies have shown that carsharing can reduce greenhouse gas emissions
  by 10 percent on average. Access to carshare programs give Angelenos options
  so that owning a second or third car is not necessary. As a result, fewer cars
  on the road and increased use of smaller and more efficient vehicles have a
  positive impact on our air quality.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: ''
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: Communications support
