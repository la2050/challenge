Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Boyle Heights Beat is a bilingual community news project produced by youth,
  offering news “por y para la comunidad." The bi-lingual paper, its companion
  website, podcast and social media presence serve as important news sources in
  a low-income, largely immigrant community.
project_description: >-
  Voices is a story-sharing project with audio and photography elements which
  will encourage youth to engage with elders. The project will help raise
  awareness around issues in their neighborhood, while building and
  strengthening intergenerational social networks.


  At the most basic level, storytelling is a way of keeping a family’s or a
  community’s stories alive. Interview topics can be tailored to address
  specific themes or community issues. Stories will be collected and archived as
  a means to create further dialogues and grow networks 
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
  - Boyle Heights
In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs) 
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Boyle Heights is a neighborhood in the East Los Angeles area of nearly 100,000
  residents. Only 5% of the population over 25 has a four-year college degree.
  Sixty-two percent of residents are low-income, with 62% having limited English
  proficiency.


  Over the past decade, Boyle Heights Beat has catered to much of the
  neighborhood’s need for information in Spanish by producing a bilingual print
  newspaper, website and podcast. This need has become even more apparent during
  this time of the Covid-19 Pandemic, where limited information has been readily
  available to the Spanish speaking population, especially with the elderly
  population.


  With many youth no longer communicating in Spanish, young and older
  populations are becoming further isolated from each other. Through "Voices"
  Boyle Heights Beat will work to build and strengthen relationships between
  youth and the elderly; creating dialogues and giving voice to both
  populations, which often are overlooked and ignored. 
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >-
  Over the last decade, Boyle Heights Beat has a proven track record in the
  neighborhood and has become a source the community relies on for information
  and engagement. Many of the issues reported by youth journalists focus on
  transformative policy and systems of change.

  A healthy community requires opportunities for residents to engage with each
  other and their leaders and a way to know their voices are heard. Through its
  storytelling Boyle Heights Beat provides residents these opportunities and
  helps influence the development of community priorities.

   By training youth as community reporters and conveners, Boyle Heights Beat helps empowers them as community leaders and agents of change. Youth reporters can help train others and help both young and old tell their stories.

  With our connections in the community, Boyle Heights Beat can partner with
  other local non-profits to publish exhibit the oral histories to create an
  even greater reach and deepen community connections.
What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: >-
  From our program’s beginnings researchers at UCSF created a survey to measure
  our project’s success and impact. We conduct these surveys and interviews with
  participant’s and community members while


  Carmen González, an undocumented former youth reporter, is currently attending
  Santa Monica City College and hosting and producing her own radio show. “Boyle
  Heights Beat taught me that I can give a voice to the voiceless. I’ve learned
  so much from my community and how to see it through different lenses. Boyle
  Heights Beat has given me the tools to uplift everyone’s story.”


  Another former youth reporter, Ricardo Ayala, graduated from UCLA and now
  works a legal assistant working to help reunite families who were separated at
  the US/Mexico border. “Boyle Heights Beat was the beginning of my journey
  towards working in community work. As a journalist, documenting the reality of
  residents in my community, I gained valuable skills that I have been able to
  put into practice.”


  District 14 Councilman José Huizar said, “Boyle Heights Beat has elevated and
  articulated a greater understanding of the issues of our day- our history, our
  triumphs, and our challenges.”


  With the help of a LA2050 grant our storytelling project can continue to tell
  important stories of our community and uplift those who don’t always have a
  voice. With the focus of connecting youth and the elderly in the community, we
  hope to add more value to our mission and develop symbiotic relationships
  which benefit the community and its residents as a whole. Our success will be
  measured by the ability to both create and sustain these relationships,
  elevate voices and issues in the community and create a network which can be
  used to help advocate for those in need. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '10000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '100000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Direct impact includes not only participants, but our average followers on our
  website and social media channels. Our indirect impact includes the number of
  Boyle Heights residents who can benefit by increasing connections in the
  community.


  Research shows that aging adults play critical roles in the lives of young
  people, especially the most vulnerable in society. The key is to change social
  norms to encourage relationship building between generations. This
  storytelling project can help cultivate a sense of purpose for both youth and
  the elderly, and help reduce isolation and the likelihood of depression.


  Through storytelling, residents are able to connect with, uplift each other
  and give voice to the issues facing the community. 
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
  - 'Office space for meetings, events, or for staff'
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: ''
Which metrics will you impact?:
  - Social and emotional support
  - Government responsiveness to residents’ needs
  - Immigrant integration
Indicate any additional LA2050 goals your project will impact.:
  - LA is the best place to LEARN
  - LA is the best place to CREATE
  - LA is the healthiest place to LIVE
Has your proposal changed due to COVID-19?: >
  Boyle Heights Beat has been continuing with its programming virtually since stay-at-home orders were put into place in mid-March. Mentors continue to meet with students on Zoom calls and students report and conduct interviews online and by phone; writing articles focusing on the current pandemic.      


  To protect their safety and the safety of others, our youth reporters can begin the Voices project with elderly persons existing in their family circles and then branch outward as safety concerns are lifted.


  If we are unable to conduct interviews in-person in the near future, Boyle Heights Beat will work with other non-profit organizations and churches serving the elderly communities to set up recording equipment to enable interviews to be done digitally.  With the additional grant funding, we can provide organizations with laptops and WIFI connections to create storytelling spaces throughout the neighborhood. 


  In light of the Covid-19 pandemic and the uncertainty of the future, we can focus our storytelling and reporting to highlight the changing and emerging needs of the community resulting from the quarantine and its aftermath- economic, mental, and social. 


  Stories will be edited, transcribed and translated as needed and aired on our podcast and published on our website and print editions. Journalist mentors and producers will work with students and outside organizations to promote and publish the content on local and national outlets. 


  Stories throughout the year will be gathered and archived. It is still our hope to create installations of the oral histories, either in public or online, as a means to engage the youth and elderly communities and further dialogues and grow intergenerational networks.
