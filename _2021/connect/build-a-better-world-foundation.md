  ~Inspired by the Charmed Life of Russell & Gina Garcia~


  We believe that youth can move the world! The aim of the Build a Better World
  Foundation is to support the empowerment of youth in this noble endeavor
  through music and the arts by sponsoring charity concerts and events, which
  include professional musicians, community leaders and spiritual leaders.
  Donations to the Build a Better World Foundation go directly to the production
  of  musical events, which not only nurture talent and leadership skills in the
  participating youth, but raise funds and awareness for existing charitable
  organizations and projects in the areas of: education, natural health, social
  justice, sustainability, science and the arts.  We currently have partnered
  with up to 25 other organizations through our events. 
     
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  It is important to our work to Empower Youth in The Arts, create awareness
  about, support and collaborate with other organizations that are doing good in
  the world to unite in Building A Better World!  A perfect platform to have
  music, invite spiritual and community leaders to speak about important topics
  in how we can create better communities and have funds go directly toward
  urgent community needs, as well as to other non~profits doing wonderful work.

  Using the concert platform is perfect, as my grandfather, Russell Garcia, was
  one of the original greats in Music!  A world renown
  composer/arranger/conductor in Hollywood, who performed numerous times at The
  Hollywood Bowl and who trained and or worked with all of the greatest
  musicians, composers.

  We have had many successful concerts and have included the United Nations at
  our last concert in 2018 and plan to include them again.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We will define and measure success by the amount of well known musicians,
  organizations, community leaders, spiritual leaders and funds raised for and
  during this event that will help to supports many very important projects and
  needs in the community.


  Our vision for success is that we will have the concert be from 3pm~10pm, live
  streamed across the globe, featuring many famous musicians, as well as young
  professionals, 20 charitable organizations, 5~7 community and spiritual
  leaders speaking, raising up to more than 3 million dollars to assist with
  important community needs, as well as benefitting the 20 charitable
  organizations.
