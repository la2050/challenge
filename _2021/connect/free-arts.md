What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >
  Trauma is becoming recognized more and more as a critical problem among
  children in the United States. Trauma stems not only from childhood abuse,
  neglect, divorce, family death, and other catastrophes, but also from
  homelessness and the ravages of poverty. Trauma in children in Los Angeles has
  reached epidemic proportions, with nearly 28% of children living below the
  poverty line, 7.6% of children in the foster care system, and 14,000 children
  living homeless on their own and many more homeless staying temporarily with
  their families. Over 34,000 children in Los Angeles are under the care of the
  Department of Child and Family Services as a result.


  Art is commonly used to help survivors of trauma. Therapeutic art programs can
  help restore hope and self-esteem, and give survivors a creative outlet that
  allows them to heal. Creative arts are an important method of addressing the
  emotional pain of trauma, providing children with a safe place in which to
  recover and heal. 
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >
  Founded in 1977, Free Arts is one of the oldest and most respected agencies
  serving this vulnerable population in Los Angeles County today. Free Arts was
  founded by an art therapist who thought doing art with foster children might
  help them cope with their situation and have a better life. Free Arts programs
  restore hope and self-esteem in children experiencing trauma from abuse,
  neglect, homelessness and poverty. 


  Each year, Free Arts serves nearly 21,000 children per year at Edmund D.
  Edelman Children’s Courthouse and 1,000 more children and families through
  partnerships with homeless and domestic violence shelters, housing programs,
  after-school programs, family resource center, Family Preservation programs
  and other nonprofits serving disadvantaged children. 
What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: "Free Arts will serve over 22,000 low-income youth in Los Angeles every year. Free Arts will achieve the following objectives annually: \n-\tServe 21,000 children through the Edmund D. Edelman Children’s Court \n-\tServe 1,000 children and families each year through partnerships with homeless and domestic violence shelters, housing programs, after school programs, family resource centers, Family Preservation Programs, and other nonprofits serving disadvantaged children\n-\tExpand to two new sites: Peace Over Violence and Flintridge Center \n-\tProvide food vouchers for 3,000 children under 12, and 6,000 caregivers, parents, and children over 12 years-old\n"
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '22000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '80000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The trauma inflicted on children lasts a lifetime. Research studies have found
  that the effects of trauma remain in human cells for life, causing myriad ill
  effects the survivor may never recognize or relate back to their trauma. Adult
  survivors are 33% more likely to perpetuate abuse on their own children, use
  drugs, and engage in criminal behavior. Interventions, such as those provided
  by Free Arts programs, can help survivors avoid lifelong problems of mental
  illness, addiction, teen pregnancy, criminal behavior and abusive
  relationships that commonly plague childhood trauma survivors.
