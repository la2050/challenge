Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    LAUSD (please select only if you have a district-wide partnership or
    project)
In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Individuals with intellectual disabilities represent the largest disabled
  population in the world. SOSC currently engages 12,959 students with
  intellectual disabilities in LAUSD (>80% from low-income families).


  Individuals with disabilities experience multiple disadvantages (Emerson
  2013), including being more likely to be unemployed long term, have physical
  and mental health problems, lack a voice in the community, and have fewer
  support networks. The seeds of lifelong disadvantage are sown early and are
  socially determined. In the school system alone, 60% of students with special
  needs report being bullied compared to 25% of general education students
  (Learning Journal 2008).


  The importance of participation and inclusion to health and well‐being is well
  known, and many determinants of chronic illness for people with an
  intellectual disability are fully modifiable via healthy lifestyles and
  activity (Davis 2014).
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >-
  SOSC’s 55 Board members and 83 staff are strongly committed to building
  community awareness and providing community education on acceptance and
  inclusion of individuals with disabilities. We:


  Have positive international brand.


  Collaborate closely with LAUSD Adapted PE Dept to provide sustainable UCS
  programming with positive outcomes.


  Reach 12,959 students with intellectual disabilities and provide 59
  competitive/exhibition events in LAUSD annually (386 schools); 100% athletes
  increase their physical fitness activity level.


  Engage 436 volunteers in LAUSD; 80% improve awareness and understanding of
  persons with disabilities.


  Partner with >600 organizations, i.e. law enforcement agencies,
  cities/communities, corporations, schools and charitable orgs.


  Provide programs free of charge to participants/families; ~84 cents of every
  dollar raised funds programs.


  Have strong UCS Program Leadership for LAUSD: Melissa Erdmann, AVP; Dustin
  Hildebrand, Manager; and Steve Munoz, Coordinator.
What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: >-
  Our Goal: Increase social inclusion of students with intellectual disabilities
  on LAUSD campuses through Special Olympics Unified Champion Schools®. Our
  Vision: Schools that Welcome All People.


  SOSC will be successful in 2020-21 school year by collaborating with LAUSD’s
  Adapted Physical Education Department to assist 21 existing UCS (with <10%
  attrition) and activate 6 new UCS in LAUSD.  Of the schools fully implementing
  UCS, SOSC expects at least 80% to:


  -Raise awareness about students with disabilities on campus; 


  -Increase opportunities for students with and without disabilities to work
  together;


  -Create a more socially inclusive school environment; and 


  -Reduce bullying, teasing, and offensive language.


  Additionally, there is developing evidence that UCS:


  -Perform better than other schools on measures of school climate (respect for
  diversity, social/civic learning, school connectedness/engagement). 


  -Improve five student social and emotional learning competencies
  (self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and
  responsible decision-making, as defined by Collaborative for Academic, Social,
  and Emotional Learning).


  SOSC measures UCS program success using surveys of school liaisons in schools
  with full UCS implementation, including mid-year report, end-of-year report,
  and UMASS Boston Liaison Survey. The UMASS study is conducted annually (11+
  years) and compares regional and national results. Results are published
  6-9-months after school year completion.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '1555'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '30590'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Special Olympics Unified Champion Schools® positively impacts the lives of all
  participants through a community of acceptance, inclusion, encouragement,
  leadership, and sport. Athletes with disabilities learn that they are valued
  human beings that deserve respect and recognition. Society is strengthened by
  bonds of shared experiences and commonalities.


  With sports as the foundation, UCS’ three-components (inclusive sports,
  inclusive youth leadership opportunities, and whole school engagement) equip
  young people with tools and training to create sports, classroom, and school
  climates of acceptance. 


  Together we are creating a Unified Generation that “Chooses to Include.”  Join
  us at:
