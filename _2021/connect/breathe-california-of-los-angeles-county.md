Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  The mission of BREATHE California of Los Angeles County (BREATHE LA) is to
  promote clean air and healthy lungs through research, education, advocacy, and
  technology.  Our vision is to eliminate the causes of lung disease and reduce
  the suffering of those afflicted by chronic respiratory conditions.
project_description: >-
  Angelenos are tired of breathing in the worst air in the nation. Blue Sky LA
  is an air quality improvement program fueled by volunteer projects that result
  in cleaner air for our County by the 2028 Olympics. Leading residents CONNECT
  through monthly volunteer opportunities, tracking the number of people
  participating in each event, and quantifying reductions in harmful emissions,
  Blue Sky LA will engage residents, promote collaboration, and establish LA
  County as the global leader in reducing air pollution so Angelenos may breathe
  easier.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Blue Sky LA addresses a startling statistic facing residents of Southern
  California:  more than 10 million people in Los Angeles County breathe in
  harmful air pollution. Eighty-eight percent is from transportation-related
  sources. Exposure to ambient air pollution can lead to reduced lung function,
  respiratory infections, aggravated asthma, COPD, bronchitis, lung cancer, and
  kidney failure. It has also been linked to decreased cognitive function,
  depression, anxiety, weaker bones, impacts on children in utero, decreased
  fertility in men, and premature death.  

  Los Angeles is known for our diversity, our welcoming communities, and our
  sunshine. Our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint will serve as a
  model for the world as we prepare to host the 2028 Summer Olympics and Para
  Olympics.  Let’s CONNECT Angelenos to improve our environment and lung health.
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >-
  BREATHE LA educates underserved populations across Southern California about
  lung and environmental health. In 2019, we reached 11,000+ students at 100+
  school sites with our after-school programs; provided asthma and vaping
  prevention programs to 1,300+ families; lung health screenings and support for
  nearly 1,000 adults; and provided educational sessions about air quality,
  access to clean technology and improved environmental sustainability to 5,000+
  people.

  Each member of our 19 person staff has a story to share about why they are
  passionate about clean air and healthy lungs.  Marc Carrel, our President and
  CEO, gets his inspiration from his three active daughters who have asthma. He
  knows how air pollution can trigger asthma attacks on bad air days and each
  day he comes to work joined by staff committed to developing more ways to
  advance lung health research, create innovative programs to improve air
  quality, and advocate for equitable reduction in exposure to pollution.
What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: "BREATHE LA will define success by the number of volunteers we engage, the number of community-based educational programs we offer, and the amount of greenhouse gases we eliminate through our “citizen-driven” projects. We will measure this success through the following projected project outcomes for year one:\n\n1.\tEngage 1,200 volunteers during year one through partnerships with community-based organizations.\n2.\tProvide 12 community-based educational sessions per year about air pollution.\n3.\tReduce greenhouse gases by 3,000,000 pounds per year.\n4.\tPlant 200 trees per year.\n5.\tCreate 5 urban gardens per year.\n6.\tIncrease public transportation users by 100 individuals.\n\nOur LA2050 vision is to showcase how community collaboration can effect change toward reduced air pollution in Los Angeles County in advance of our hosting the 2028 Olympics and Paralympics.  \n\nOur program goals for Blue Sky LA goals include continuing to increase awareness about the importance of  air pollution reduction through community education, reducing asthma emergency room visits that result from poor air quality, decreasing vehicle emissions, and increasing awareness about innovative clean technology and environmentally friendly products."
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '1200'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '10000000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  BREATHE LA will achieve broader goals of improving lung health (reducing NOx,
  PM2.5, and VOCs), improved public health and quality of life (reducing asthma
  emergency room visits due to air quality), and greater access to clean
  technology (increasing awareness about innovative and environmentally-friendly
  technologies and incentive/rebate programs for energy efficient auto and home
  solutions). Blue Sky LA will not only make the Los Angeles community
  healthier, but also serve as a model for other California communities and
  beyond.
'Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.': >-
  BREATHE LA will collaborate with both California State University, Northridge
  (CSUN) and Climate Cents on this project.  CSUN will provide students who will
  help to plan, implement, and evaluate volunteer-based community activities
  that reduce community air pollution. Climate Cents will help to build and
  maintain a digital platform to track volunteers and air quality improvement
  progress. 


  BREATHE LA also works regularly with 250 community partners. These
  organizations include schools, parent organizations, senior citizen groups and
  faith-based groups. We use our community partner database to identify which
  organizations align with our projects based on the specific needs or a
  population or geography.  These relationships will be used to recruit
  volunteers for our Blue Sky LA events.

  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
  - 'Office space for meetings, events, or for staff'
