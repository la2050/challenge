What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  There are 60,000 people experiencing homelessness throughout the County of Los
  Angeles, and upwards of 32,000 people experiencing homelessness in the City of
  Los Angeles. The Living Through Giving Foundation is committed to reaching all
  60,000 Angelenos experiencing homelessness via our #HashtagLunchbag program. 
  #HashtagLunchbag hosts a monthly event in which we build and provide
  nutritious meals and notes of encouragement to fellow Angelenos experiencing
  homelessness, and connect residents of the city to volunteer opportunities.
  The monthly #HashtagLunchbag events and by request corporate activations
  strengthen and connect the Angeleno community. In addition to addressing food
  insecurity and providing meals to people experiencing homelessness; the
  program also inspires volunteers to learn more about the social crisis of
  homelessness, raises awareness on solutions to address food insecurity and
  homelessness, and motivates volunteers to serve. #HashtagLunchbag connects all
  Angelenos.
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >-
  #HashtagLunchbag is nearing its 8th year of connecting Angelenos from across
  the Los Angeles metropolitan area at monthly events.  On average, the
  organization creates and distributes approximately 1,600 meals to people
  experiencing homelessness, via single day events hosted each month.  We seek
  to increase our impact and expand our capabilities by increasing the number of
  meals and number of events, in order to reach a wider demographic and square
  mileage. Our meals are currently distributed around Skid Row. If selected to
  receive funding, we will expand our distribution area to include Central LA
  and the Westside. #HashtagLunchbag is uniquely suited to take this on because
  our programs have a proven service delivery model and sustainable impact.
  #HashtagLunchbag seeks to increase its service capabilities to meet the rising
  need to address food insecurity throughout Los Angeles, especially for people
  experiencing homelessness.
What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: >-
  At each event, we maintain records of the number of meals distributed, the
  number of volunteers who participate, and the amount of donations received to
  help cover the cost of food and supplies.  In Los Angeles, on average, we
  create and distribute approximately 1,600 meals with the support of 150
  volunteers each month. Our social media networks reach tens of thousands of
  individuals who engage with us.  Many folks have expressed interest in joining
  events, with the hope that meals would be distributed in areas near their own
  homes, such as beach cities, mid city, Hollywood, Koreatown, and around
  downtown Los Angeles.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '50000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '4500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our impact is to address food insecurity, feed a large number of people
  experiencing homelessness in the LA area, and connect LA residents through a
  fun and interactive experience. Collectively, #HashtagLunchbag inspires and
  empowers the community to further implement their service driven mindset and
  increase their community impact of giving forward in their lives, outside of
  our events.  We seek to bring awareness to our community, to inspire fellow
  Angelenos to live with a standard of good, unique in its own right.
