What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  There are over 66,000 people experiencing homelessness throughout the County
  of Los Angeles, & upwards of 32,000 people experiencing homelessness in the
  City of Los Angeles. The Living Through Giving Foundation is committed to
  reaching all Angelenos experiencing homelessness via our #HashtagLunchbag
  program, to provide meals throughout the course of one year, with the help of
  this grant.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  #HashtagLunchbag hosts a monthly event in which we build and provide
  nutritious meals and notes of encouragement to fellow Angelenos experiencing
  homelessness, and connect residents of the city to volunteer opportunities.
  The socially distanced monthly #HashtagLunchbag events will strengthen and
  connect the Angeleno community. In addition to addressing food insecurity and
  providing meals to people experiencing homelessness; the program also inspires
  volunteers to learn more about the social crisis of homelessness, raises
  awareness on solutions to address food insecurity and homelessness, and
  motivates volunteers to serve. #HashtagLunchbag connects Angelenos.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  At each event, we maintain records of the number of meals distributed, the
  number of volunteers who participate, and the amount of donations received to
  help cover the cost of food and supplies. In Los Angeles, on average, we
  create and distribute approximately 1,600 meals each month. Our social media
  networks reach tens of thousands of individuals who engage with us. Many folks
  have expressed interest in joining events, with the hope that meals would be
  distributed in areas near their own homes, such as beach cities, mid city,
  Hollywood, Koreatown, and around downtown Los Angeles.  This current time is
  unique, however, in that we will request volunteers to RSVP in advance, and to
  the nature of their participation, so that we do our part in keeping this
  initiative safe and socially distanced.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '48000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our impact is to address food insecurity, feed a large number of people
  experiencing homelessness in the LA area, and connect LA residents through a
  fun and interactive experience. Collectively, #HashtagLunchbag inspires and
  empowers the community to further implement their service driven mindset and
  increase their community impact of giving forward in their lives, outside of
  our events. We seek to bring awareness to our community, to inspire fellow
  Angelenos to live with a standard of good, unique in its own right.  Our goal
  is to connect Angelenos through inspiring and empowering give-back
  initiatives, using food as our catalyst for change, hoping to change the
  hearts and minds of residents of Los Angeles, one lunchbag at a time.
