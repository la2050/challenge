Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  InsightLA aims to help people: live mindfully, offering evidence-based

project_description: >-
  InsightLA is requesting support of its Insight in Action (IIA) program, which
  offers meditation teachings and community-building activities to vulnerable
  and marginalized populations and to healthcare workers and caregivers
  responding to suffering. This year, IIA will continue to work with existing
  partner organizations and expand programming for individuals and organizations
  recovering from the effects of Covid-19 whether because of illness, loss,
  economic instability, or vicarious trauma experienced in the line of duty.  
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - South Bay
In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >
  Many Angelenos experience suffering due to systemic challenges like
  homelessness, poverty, illness, and discrimination. IIA comprises three
  components to mitigate this suffering: community outreach, through which we
  partner with non-profit organizations and schools to bring secular mindfulness
  practices to vulnerable populations and those serving them; affinity groups
  where people can meditate with others of shared identity; and daylong retreats
  for healthcare workers and caregivers.  


  Due to the global pandemic caused by SARS CoV-2, LA faces an unprecedented
  crisis which threatens the health and well-being of its citizens and strains
  our healthcare system. Research shows that mindfulness meditation increases
  capacity for emotional regulation, decreases anxiety and depression, and helps
  practitioners gain compassion and acceptance. These are some of the reasons
  why mindfulness meditation has proven to be particularly effective for those
  facing high levels of stress or illness. 
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >
  When InsightLA (ILA) founder and Guiding Teacher Trudy Goodman set out to
  offer mindfulness teachings in Los Angeles in 2003, she dedicated herself to
  relieving suffering. She started by teaching mindfulness practices to
  incarcerated minors and pediatric patients, but quickly discovered a profound
  need among social and healthcare workers struggling with vicarious trauma and
  compassion fatigue. The Insight in Action program developed in response, and
  is suited to meet the need presented by the COVID-19 crisis because it is
  simply an extension of the work we already do.


  ILA is a leading meditation center in Los Angeles, serving more than 10,000
  individuals annually, and is known for the quality of its teachers. Many of
  ILA’s 55 teachers are trained in popular secular mindfulness practices
  including mindful self-compassion and mindfulness-based stress reduction. ILA
  has three locations, and is equipped to offer mindfulness practices remotely
  and in person. 
What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: >
  Success for this project would mean that IIA is connecting with organizations
  and individuals with a real need and interest in mindfulness meditation
  practices. We hope to form new partnerships with hospitals and non-profit
  organizations who are working on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis. We
  will also form affinity groups for essential workers, healthcare
  professionals, aging adults, and others. We will start this effort by scanning
  our existing networks to determine where there may be connectivity, and
  conduct outreach as needed.


  Success will also mean that individuals and organizations are receiving
  mindfulness teachings clearly and in a way that directly relates to their
  lives. InsightLA will work with each organization to determine what is needed
  and develop modules or class series that can meet demonstrated need. For
  instance, InsightLA could work with a team of individuals at a hospital using
  a “train the trainer” model to help deliver mindfulness practices more widely
  at the institution. Or, InsightLA could develop a special class series
  tailored to the needs and concerns of a specific group. 


  Success will also mean that InsightLA is gaining institutional knowledge and
  adapting to improve program elements. To that end, InsightLA will distribute
  before and after surveys to see whether participants feel that mindfulness
  classes have positively impacted them, and analyze them to determine trends
  and/or areas for improvement. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '4035'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '10265'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >
  Practitioners of mindfulness meditation often notice that the benefits of
  their practice affect not only themselves, but ripple out to those in
  relationship to them. Our work with healthcare professionals and caregivers in
  particular shows us that meditation can help prevent burnout and positively
  impact the way healthcare services are delivered—we have estimated that 10
  individuals will be indirectly impacted by the services we provide to
  healthcare workers. 


  And, many people ILA has worked with express that they feel connected to those
  they practice with. In a time of collective trauma, mindfulness meditation can
  provide a collective healing, helping organizations and individuals rebuild
  and recover together. 
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Communications support
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: ''
