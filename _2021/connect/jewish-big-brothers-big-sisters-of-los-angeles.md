  Teen Talk is a free mobile app for teens to seek social and emotional support
  anonymously from trained teen advisors. Teen Talk supports 26,000 registered
  app users worldwide and each month approximately 1,500 new users download the
  app. JBBBSLA trains Los Angeles-area teens to become advisors for the app.
  Teen advisors complete a 50-hour in-person training that teaches empathetic
  listening and communication techniques. This grant will enable Teen Talk to
  train more teen advisors to serve growing numbers of app users.

What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  With a near-constant attachment to their mobile devices, and a lack of mental
  health support in general, teens seek mental health support online. A national
  survey sponsored by Hopelab and Well Being Trust finds that 59% of teens have
  searched online for information about mental well-being, including stress
  (44%), anxiety (42%), and depression (39%). Among teens with moderate to
  severe depression, 90% say they have gone online for information on mental
  health issues. The survey concludes that “the digital health revolution has
  arrived for this generation of young people. Technology and the internet have
  transformed how teens and young adults search for information, share stories
  and experiences, and connect to one another about health.” When it comes to
  mental health, teens now go online. To help teens, providers must meet them
  where they are – and because of Teen Talk, that is happening every day.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Over the past 7 years, JBBBSLA has expanded its programs to serve teens (i.e.,
  teen camp, teen empowerment workshops, college guidance. Based on research and
  interviews with teens, JBBBSLA learned that teens want and need accessible
  resources for social and emotional support. Over 30 interviews with youth
  professionals including school counselors, therapists, and social service
  providers confirmed that a strategy to serve teens facing social and emotional
  challenges needed to be developed. Given that most youth are unwilling to seek
  therapeutic interventions due to time, location or cost as well as stigma,
  JBBBSLA determined that using technology in the form of a mobile app to
  provide social and emotional support would be the most effective way to
  deliver these vital services. This modality allows for anonymous, no cost,
  support where and when the teen needs it, all from the privacy of their mobile
  device. Teen Talk has 26,000 app users worldwide and 2,500 of them live in Los
  Angeles. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "The teen advisor training prepares teens to respond to their peers on the app, yet the larger goal is to develop a community of teens in Los Angeles that will recreate this supportive community in real life in Los Angeles. In order to track Teen Talk’s success towards this goal, it is necessary to track both the app user experience and the teen advisor experience. Three evaluation methods are being used: 1) In-app technology allowing a “thumbs up or thumbs down” rating of the service by the app user; 2) Monitoring the analytics derived from user engagement; and 3) Outside program evaluator  will report on the experience, impact, and outcomes of the app users, teen advisors, and supervisors.  JBBBSLA’s vision: 1) Hundreds of Los Angeles teens are trained to become teen advisors. The teen advisors report great satisfaction helping other teens in need of social and emotional support and additionally, they experience increased involvement in their own communities. 2) Tens of thousands of teens in need have access to social and emotional support from peers who can relate to them. Teen Talk is a vital resource to help teens understand and address issues in their lives. \n\nIn order to achieve this vision, JBBBSLA needs funding to:\n*\tIncrease recruitment efforts to identify potential teen advisors in Los Angeles.\n*\tOffer additional training cohorts to accommodate greater numbers of teens in training program. \n*\tIncrease staffing to support increased training and support of teen advisors. \n"
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '52240'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '208960'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The need for mental health resources is serious, given that 7,092 teens living
  in Los Angeles were hospitalized for mental health issues in 2018
  (kidsdata.org). Since 2018, 2,000 teens from Los Angeles have downloaded the
  app and more than 100 Los Angeles-area teens have become trained teen
  advisors. Currently, the app is available to iPhone users. By  2021, the app
  will be available to Android users and we anticipate the number of users to
  double. As JBBBSLA increases its capacity to operate Teen Talk and reach teens
  around the world and in Los Angeles, we will be fulfilling LA2050’s goal to
  CONNECT.
