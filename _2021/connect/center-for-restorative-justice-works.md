project_description: >-
  Every child has the right to build a loving relationship with their parents,
  even if a parent is in prison. Keeping children connected with incarcerated
  parents has been shown to improve the health and wellbeing of children, to
  reduce recidivism rates, and build stronger communities. Beyond the Bus is a
  transformative program that offers children the chance to maintain connection
  and personal relationships with a parent in prison through virtual visits and
  expanded opportunities for in-person visits after the pandemic.

  Todo niño tiene derecho a entablar una relación amorosa con sus padres, incluso si uno de los padres está en prisión. Se ha demostrado que mantener a los niños conectados con padres encarcelados mejora la salud y el bienestar de los niños, reduce las tasas de reincidencia y construye comunidades más fuertes. Get On The Bus (Sube al Autobús) es un programa transformador que ofrece a los niños la oportunidad de mantener la conexión y las relaciones personales con un padre en prisión a través de visitas virtuales y oportunidades ampliadas para visitas en persona después de la pandemia.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Children are often denied the chance to connect with a parent in prison,
  either because the parent is too far away to visit or because children can’t
  afford the cost of expensive phone calls or car rides. Estimates suggest more
  than 80,000 children in LA County have a parent behind bars (pre-pandemic).
  60% of incarcerated parents in California report being more than 100 miles
  away from their families. Parental incarceration impacts the whole family:
  loss of family income, the daily absence of a parent, and physical separation.
  Many children are forced to live with extended family or enter foster care. A
  2015 study found 32% of affected children had behavioral problems, and 38%
  experienced mental health or medical problems. By failing to keep families
  connected our criminal justice system is failing children in our communities.
  Offered the chance to connect regularly, children demonstrate better health
  and education outcomes, and incarcerated parents have lower recidivism rates.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Recent policy changes in California permit children to connect with a parent
  in prison through video visits. It's a gamechanger for children who sometimes
  go years without being able to say “I love you” to their parents. Beyond the
  Bus is a pioneering program that empowers children in LA County to make these
  precious connections on a regular basis. Beyond the Bus will establish 10 Hubs
  throughout LA County that provide internet connectivity, Wifi-capable tablets,
  and safe spaces for video visits. Hubs will be located at schools or
  faith-based institutions with a history of serving this community. Beyond the
  Bus isn't just about providing connectivity – it’s about bringing together a
  community of volunteers, local organizations, and people to support one of LA
  County’s most vulnerable populations. Children are often referred to as the
  “forgotten victims of the criminal justice system.” We need to go 'beyond the
  bus' to make sure that we do not leave these children behind. Hubs will
  provide food, fun activities, homework help, and access to a network of caring
  volunteers and professional staff. Volunteers will assist children and
  families in filling out forms to register for video visits, provide English
  language assistance, and register families for in-person visits after the
  pandemic. Hubs will also serve as important communication channels to inform
  families about policy changes, and to gather information about the number of
  children experiencing parental incarceration.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Beyond the Bus expands an existing program called Get on the Bus (GOTB). GOTB
  provides free transportation for children to visit a parent at California’s
  state prisons once a year. From 2001-2021, GOTB served over 15,000 children.
  With video visits now authorized, Beyond the Bus can expand family
  reunification services and video visits to over 80,000 LA County children, and
  turn GOTB’s annual program into a monthly event. The pandemic has laid bare
  the need to innovate new programs and services so that connection between
  child and parent remains constant. Beyond the Bus provides a solution that is
  achievable, scalable, and which directly addresses basic needs for children of
  incarcerated parents. To evaluate success, Hubs will collect data on the
  number of children served, as well as information on important impact factors
  like school attendance. Impact studies from GOTB clearly show that regular
  connection improves the health and wellbeing of children, and lowers
  recidivism rates.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '50000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Far too often, children are denied the chance to connect with a parent in
  prison. This causes lasting damage to family relationships and communities.
  Family separation due to parental incarceration is not the child’s fault, and
  yet children suffer greatly from the impacts of incarceration. These children
  are more likely to grow up in poverty and to experience behavioral and
  emotional problems. We can work to reverse the effects of family separation
  for thousands of children in LA County through Beyond the Bus! Impact for this
  program will be measured in the number of children served, the frequency of
  video visits, improved attendance and performance in school, and increased
  access to in-person visits after the pandemic. An added benefit will be
  collecting accurate data on the number of children with incarcerated parents
  in LA County – information that is not regularly reported and could greatly
  improve support services to affected families.
