Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  New Horizons' mission is to empower individuals with disabilities to reach
  their full potential.  Together we’re building an inclusive world that
  celebrates strengths, respects abilities, and embraces diversity.
project_description: >-
  The My LA2050 grant will support New Horizons’ efforts to provide increased
  opportunities and options for individuals with intellectual and/or
  developmental disabilities to participate in and connect with the community,
  through volunteerism, employment, social interaction and meaningful
  involvement. We will develop a coordinated transportation system to more
  efficiently utilize agency vehicles, public transportation, and other mobility
  options to facilitate greater access to and  participation in the community. 
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Fernando Valley
In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  New Horizons’ goal is to expand opportunities for individuals with
  intellectual and/or developmental disabilities (I/DD) to achieve greater
  access to meaningful community involvement, connection and impact. For years,
  adults with I/DD have been provided services in segregated/"disabled only"
  settings or campuses. We believe, and recent federal legislation requires,
  that services and supports be provided in the most integrated environment
  possible..the community.  New Horizons has adapted its campus-based learning,
  job training and recreation services for over 750 individuals to be conducted
  in community settings. By implementing a coordinated transportation system, we
  will be able to maximize use of agency vehicles and public transportation to
  transport more people and more of our mobility-challenged participants, to
  community sites.
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >+
  For over 66 years New Horizons has recognized the value and contributions of
  individuals with special needs.  We  believe in an inclusive world that
  celebrates strengths, respects abilities, and embraces diversity.  We are
  securing additional employers to hire people with disabilities, recruiting
  more non-profit partners to engage our clients as volunteers, and increasing
  local businesses and resources where our clients shop and play.   By
  coordinating our limited number of vehicles to a route system we will be able
  to efficiently transport more people out into the community for longer periods
  of time. New Horizons' 66-year history of high-level accreditation reviews,
  award-winning programming in employment services, and relationships with over
  400 businesses and non-profit agencies, positions us as a seasoned and
  innovative organization dedicated to creating brighter futures for people with
  disabilities and our great L.A. community. 


What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: >-
  Our ultimate vision of success is inclusion of people with
  intellectual/developmental disabilities in all aspects of the community...as 
  neighbors, co-workers, classmates, friends.  Specific to this project, we will
  define success as the development and implementation of a coordinated
  transportation route system that will maximize the use of vehicles and public
  transportation to increase numbers of program participants involved in:
  community-based activities; volunteer assignments; employment training;
  employment. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '350'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '3500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The 350 individuals participating in this project are adults with intellectual
  and/or developmental disabilities. Approximately 15% also have a physical
  disability. The 3500 reflects the co-workers and volunteer agency recipients
  and site coordinators. By implementing a transportation route system, we will
  be able to transport more participants (and more with mobility challenges) to
  sites using our vehicles in a pick-up/drop-off plan. This will allow
  participants to also stay longer at volunteer or activity sites, rather than
  having to return due to shared vehicle with another activity group. This
  system may lead to additional volunteer or employment opportunities as it will
  increase the time-frame for involvement at a site.
'Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.': >-
  Although we will be working with special education programs from LAUSD
  schools, local companies, and local non-profit organizations, this is not a
  collaborative proposal.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Communications support
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: ''
Which metrics will you impact?:
  - Volunteerism
  - Disability access and inclusion
Indicate any additional LA2050 goals your application will impact.:
