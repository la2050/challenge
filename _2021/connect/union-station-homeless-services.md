Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Guided by our belief that everyone deserves a life of dignity and a place to
  call home, Union Station Homeless Services’ mission is to help individuals and
  families rebuild their lives and end homelessness across the San Gabriel
  Valley. 
project_description: >-
  The Community Allies Program was launched in response to the isolation and
  loneliness reported by families and individuals we served as they settled into
  their new homes. The program seeks to increase housing retention rates,
  improve community connection, and foster community integration of currently
  homeless families and individuals in bridge-housing and those that are
  formerly homeless in permanent supportive housing by providing social and
  recreational activities and pairing individuals with a supportive community
  volunteer ally.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Gabriel Valley
In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  During periods of homelessness, people often become disconnected from friends
  and families. Once housed, it can be difficult to organically reestablish a
  network capable of providing social and emotional support. Research and Union
  Station’s nearly five decades of work indicate that formerly homeless people
  often experience persistent social isolation after moving into permanent
  housing. In a recent study, people who were formerly homeless cited,
  “disconnection and alienation in their neighborhoods” (Fields, 2010). 


  Through our Community Allies Program, we address this need by building a
  network of personalized care to help families and individuals currently
  experiencing homelessness or formerly homeless increase their likelihood of
  retaining housing and thriving in their new environments. By providing avenues
  for social engagement and community connections, our program facilitates a
  smooth transition into housing, furthering our work to end homelessness across
  the San Gabriel Valley.
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >-
  Since our founding in 1973, Union Station has remained on the cutting edge of
  the homelessness sector, pairing innovation with individualized services that
  meet people where they are at. The Community Allies Program is a key example
  of how we continue to be responsive and evolve our programming to meet the
  holistic needs of homeless and newly-housed individuals and families. Since
  launching the program in 2017, we have seen the immeasurable benefits of
  providing community integration and social-emotional support services
  including improved housing retention rates and feeling connected to the
  community. Union Station therefore seeks to expand the program to engage more
  participants and volunteers. Through our position as Lead Agency of the
  Coordinated Entry System for Families and for Individuals in Service Planning
  Area 3, and our successful record of adopting cutting-edge approaches, we are
  well-positioned to further advance the Community Allies Program across the San
  Gabriel Valley.
What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: "Through the Community Allies Program, our vision for success includes:\n*\tServing at least 85 families and individuals in bridge housing or permanent supportive housing;\n*\tProviding 50 new participants with community integration support services;\n*\tRecruiting and training 30 new volunteer community allies;\n*\tSustaining engagement with 35 current program participants and 45 current volunteer community allies; and\n*\tCreating 30 new successful matches and maintain those connections for at least six months (NOTE: some participants and allies are not immediately matched; we engage them through events and referrals to ensure they receive reintegration services as they wait for the right match to be made).\n\nAs a result of our work, we anticipate:\n*\t90% of participants receiving community integration support services will retain their housing;\n*\t80% of participants are satisfied with their new housing and neighborhood;\n*\t75% of participants will feel an improved quality of life; and\n*\t50% of participants will report feeling connected to their new community.\n\nTo evaluate the success of our Community Allies program, we conduct surveys using a quality of life indicator tool to measure outcomes for participants who have been in the program for at least six months. Additionally, our housing programs collect data from participants about what services they are receiving and housing retention rates, which is entered into the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) database."
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '160'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '4700'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  LA County is at the center of our nation’s homelessness crisis with the
  largest unsheltered population in the nation. Union Station recognizes that
  addressing homelessness requires more than just providing shelter. Ensuring
  that newly-housed individuals have the resources and supports necessary to
  thrive in their community is critical to increasing housing retention. As a
  lead agency in our region, Union Station seeks to pave the way for wide-scale
  implementation of community integration services by expanding our effective,
  replicable model. In so doing, we aim to combat homelessness while making LA
  County a region where all residents have the opportunity to engage and
  contribute meaningfully to their community.

Has your proposal changed due to COVID-19?: >
  Community Allies believes that creating opportunities for authentic human connection is more important than ever in light of COVID-19. At this time, we are prioritizing the safety of our volunteers and participants by cancelling all in-person activities until further notice. We have adapted programming and expanded opportunities for connection through new pilot initiatives such as “Phone Pals,” in which new friendships are facilitated over the phone. This offering has been especially impactful for Project Roomkey residents, who are highly vulnerable people experiencing homelessness who have been sheltered in motel rooms, and are thus extremely isolated.

  Volunteer Allies who were already matched with participants before March 2020 continue to log volunteer hours by checking on their participants by phone on a regular basis, providing social and emotional support. Our team has also built an extensive library of virtual community gatherings/activities that has been disseminated across our networks.  

  Additionally, we remain committed to elevating the voices of those with lived experience through our LEAP (Lived Expertise Advisory Panel) Committee. LEAP members have currently or formerly experienced homelessness and serve in an advisory capacity to the board of directors and staff on issues related to service provision, advocacy, and policy.  LEAP members have continued to meet virtually and are currently focused on advocacy efforts related to affordable housing.
