Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Creative Healing for Youth in Pain (chyp) is a nonprofit for youth with
  chronic pain and their parents/caregivers, providing resources online to
  reduce barriers like cost and location. chyp encourages creative healing and
  social support to strengthen the mind/body connection and increase function. 
project_description: >-
  chyp’s PhotoVoice for youth living with chronic pain and their parents is a
  pilot program. Participants take photos to illustrate their experience with
  persistent pain and coping. The project empowers participants to document
  their lives using cameras, fostering individual and community change through
  social connections. Documenting a chronic health condition with photography,
  with the added benefit of peer support online, can highlight areas of health
  disparities and provide feelings of connectedness in an otherwise isolating
  journey.

In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Research shows that 15% of adolescents have chronic pain, and over half
  regularly miss school and activities because of the pain. This has serious
  developmental impacts for young people, including an increased risk of
  anxiety, depression, suicide, substance abuse, and future pain disability. In
  fact, 70% of teens with chronic pain will have persistent pain as adults if
  not properly addressed during adolescence. Health issues extend to family
  members. Parenting a child with chronic pain can result in missed work,
  financial stress, poor self-care, and mental health issues. The negative
  impact of pediatric chronic pain has been established, but there are still
  many barriers like socioeconomic status, location, insurance, and
  transportation. chyp utilizes the current tech-focused climate to provide
  resources online, so families can get the help they need in their own homes.
  For this project, chyp focuses on photography as a creative outlet, coping
  skill, and tool for dialogue. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  chyp was founded by pediatric chronic pain expert, Lonnie Zeltzer, MD, a
  Distinguished Research Professor of Pediatrics, Anesthesiology, Psychiatry and
  Biobehavioral Sciences at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and
  Immediate Past-Director of the UCLA Pediatric Pain and Palliative Care
  Program. She is a co-author on the Institute of Medicine report on
  Transforming Pain in America and was a member of the national steering
  committee to provide directions for pain research at the National Institutes
  of Health (NIH). Georgia Weston, MSW, is the Executive Director of chyp and
  has spent a decade in the chronic pain world as an author, nonprofit Director,
  and therapist - and as a chronic pain patient since 14. chyp has professional
  experience (an international Clinical Advisory) and personal experience (a
  Youth Advisory Board and Parent/Caregiver Advisory Board). The chyp team uses
  their combined backgrounds and evidence-based creative healing options to
  provide online services.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  With PhotoVoice, chyp envisions a growing community of patients working to
  transform pain and isolation into empowerment and connection. Photography and
  social support are immediate coping skills that mitigate the impact of pain.
  Long-term effects offer feelings of connectedness and proof that at-home
  healing reduces healthcare barriers. Results will be disseminated through
  social media, websites, and Dr. Zeltzer’s contacts. Through six group cycles
  (12 participants/group) there will be two groups aged 13-17, two groups aged
  18-25, and two groups for parents. An initial Zoom meeting will discuss
  expectations, followed by two weeks to take photos. Each cycle will end with a
  Zoom meeting to share photos and process with peers, led by mental health
  professionals. To measure success there will be a pre- and post-test. Outcomes
  will be based on quantitative rating scales and qualitative interviews: 1. To
  what extent do you feel you expressed your pain and/or coping to others? 2. To
  what extent do you feel connected to others? and 3. Percent of program
  completion. Questions 1 and 2 will have a 0-10 scale (0/not at all -
  10/extremely), and will be considered successful if the mean change of the age
  grouping’s pre- and post-score increases by at least two points. At least 65%
  of participants completing pre- and post-meetings, and submitting two photos,
  will be considered a success. chyp will host a photo exhibit so LA can see the
  world of chronic pain.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '72'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '720'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Persistent pain hinders daily functioning and leads to isolation. Research
  shows that social support is a major factor in reducing the negative effects
  of chronic pain (including mental health problems and substance abuse).
  Learning creative outlets (e.g. photography) as coping skills can be
  empowering, enhance self-esteem, and increase feelings of connectedness to a
  greater community. The portfolio at the end will spread awareness of pediatric
  chronic pain and creative healing. The participants’ stories will be carried
  throughout LA and online so peers can feel represented and validated. chyp
  understands that social support and feelings of connectedness do not have to
  be a two-way communication, but includes the power of story-telling.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Communications support
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
