Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  The Sloane Stephens Foundation empowers children around the world to dream big
  and achieve on and off the court. Our vision is to help shape constructive

project_description: >-
  US Open Champion Sloane Stephens launched Love, Love Compton in 2015 to combat
  social, economic, and academic inequalities in Compton by creating educational
  opportunities and safe spaces to play and grow. SSF’s tennis programming is
  designed to positively impact the lives of our students far beyond the tennis
  court. SSF believes in the transformative power of healthy habits,
  self-confidence, and education, and uses tennis as our vehicle to change the
  narrative of poverty, health inequity, and educational underdevelopment in
  Compton.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Love, Love Compton began in 2015 to combat social, economic, and academic
  inequalities in Compton through year-round educational pathways and safe
  places to play and grow. Our Compton community is one of the most dangerous in
  the country, with a homicide rate higher than 95.7% of US cities. The need for
  safe play areas is critical in a city where crime and poverty are a daily
  reality for the majority of its residents. It can be too dangerous to walk to
  and from the tennis courts alone, particularly for our youngest students, and
  many parents are unable to pick up their children based on their work
  schedules and other commitments.  Improving access to free and safe play is
  vital in a community where about 60% of residents are under the age of 16. The
  students we serve are 30% Black and 67% Latinx, and 99% will be
  first-generation college attendees. About 60% of children in Compton live
  below 200% of the federal poverty level, and 100% of our students are eligible
  for free/reduced lunch.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Tennis is a sport that has high economic barriers to entry, and is often
  perceived to be an upper class sport. We deeply believe in eradicating these
  barriers so our youth can be exposed to the physical, emotional, and social
  benefits of a lifelong sport and understand that there are no limits or
  barriers to their dreams. Our Love, Love Compton programming exposes >2,000
  Compton youth to tennis annually and incorporates after-school, recess,
  summer, and weekend tennis and academic tutoring to teach children the
  fundamentals of tennis in a safe, supportive environment. While playing
  tennis, children have fun, improve their overall physical fitness, and learn
  to manage adversity, solve problems, and develop a sense of fair play.  SSF
  provides Love, Love Compton students with free instruction, equipment, and
  individualized academic enrichment. All of our programming takes place on
  Compton Unified campuses so that families can be reassured knowing that their
  children are somewhere familiar and safe. Our program is innovative in its
  approach and community-first model. 100% of SSF coaches are from Compton, and
  we develop and retain them to be community leaders and role models. All
  current coaches are graduates of our program and have chosen to stay involved
  while pursuing their own higher-education. All of our academic tutors are CUSD
  educators, and this extra level of familiarity allows us to quickly target a
  child’s specific needs and be cognizant of their outside circumstances. 
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  SSF is described by CUSD Superintendent Dr. Darin Brawley as the district’s
  “most successful and influential non-profit relationship.” Since 2015, Love,
  Love Compton has expanded from 3 elementary schools to serving over 2,000
  students annually across 19 elementary schools, 4 middle schools, and two high
  schools. 100% of our students graduate from high school, and 100% go on to a 2
  or 4 year college. We continue to refine evaluation metrics such as improved
  fitness, healthy nutrition habits and better academic/social performance. We
  seek significant results that are both quantitative and qualitative, short and
  long-term, as our ultimate goals of improving equity, creating the next
  generation of tennis players, and fostering positive generational change.  SSF
  tracks overall programming success by evidence of: 1. Growth of tennis
  activity in CUSD 2.100% graduation rate across cohorts 3. Observable
  improvements in attendance, chronic behavioral problems and academic
  performance. 
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Through our work, more underserved children in LA County will have safe places
  and opportunities to play, grow, and dream. Children are empowered to learn a
  new sport and develop the social and emotional skills needed to thrive in and
  out of the classroom. With every new child we serve, we impact an entire
  family, and over time, a generation. Our 100% high-school graduation rate is a
  transformative achievement that meaningfully improves job prospects and
  earning potential. By learning to play tennis and having opportunities to be
  physically active, our community becomes healthier and children have
  opportunities to compete with integrity, create new life experiences, and
  develop leadership skills. Short term, we achieve these goals by introducing
  as many kids as possible to tennis. Through this consistent and sustained
  work, it feeds our long term goal of creating pathways to generational change
  by using tennis as our vehicle to promote healthy active lifestyles and
  academic excellence.
