Please describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Nature for All’s mission is to work to build a diverse base of support for
  ensuring that everyone in the Los Angeles area —no matter where they live—has
  equitable access to the wide range of benefits that nature can provide.
project_description: >-
  Community base building is an essential step toward achieving equitable
  investment in healthy communities. Nature for All’s Leadership Development
  proposal will cultivate community members and leaders to be well-equipped to
  advocate for their community’s needs for more parks, open space, and transit
  options. 
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to PLAY
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - San Fernando Valley
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  In Los Angeles, where you live determines your health. Communities with the
  least access to parks and recreation also have the worst health outcomes and
  are primarily inhabited by low-income families and people of color. A 2016 LA
  County DPH report found that communities with less park space/capita on
  average had higher rates of premature mortality from cardiovascular disease
  and diabetes, higher prevalence of childhood obesity, and greater economic
  hardship than places with more park space/capita.


  LA voters recently approved tax increases to improve park access, improve
  water resilience, and transit to public lands. Decisions for how to use those
  tax dollars are being made now. However, community leaders from these areas
  may lack an understanding of the technical and procedural aspects and can be
  shut out of the advocacy process for funding for their communities. To reduce
  health inequities and improve health, we need an engaged citizenry that can
  advocate for its community’s needs.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Nature for All’s Leadership Development program trains communities of color
  and low-income communities to engage in the decision-making that distributes
  voter-approved parks, water resilience, and transit funding. Nature for All
  effectively engaged high-need communities on many of these same policy issues
  over the last several years. We organized more than 500 hundred community
  members to attend and participate in public meetings related to: 1) the
  Measure A Parks and Open Space parcel tax; 2) Measure M, an LA County sales
  tax to fund public transportation, greenways, and bicycle infrastructure; and
  3) Measure W, a parcel tax for water quality, water conservation, and
  community investments. Nature for All’s Leadership Development program ensures
  that the diversity of community voices are heard and expressed in our policy
  choices, and we have seen great success in our efforts as evidenced by the
  passage of all of those funding measures by Los Angeles voters.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our vision of success is that participants from communities that have long
  been absent from environmental decision-making begin to build their leadership
  and participation in crucial environmental decisions and funding opportunities
  that can benefit their communities. We consider our project successful if they
  gain knowledge of environmental issues and can navigate the processes for
  taking community action. Their leadership can ultimately have an impact on the
  following metrics defined by LA2050: Access to open space and park facilities;
  Easy access to a safe park; Obesity; and Parks with intergenerational play
  opportunities. 


  We will use pre- and post-testing surveys of training participants to gauge
  their learning over the course of the training. The surveys will use a mix of
  quantitative and qualitative methods to measure what was learned in the
  training. We seek to measure the degree to which participants in the program
  know: 1) how access to parks and open space impacts their communities and
  families; and 2) how to communicate with the decision makers on issues that
  are important to them.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '7500'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '15000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  It is critical that the communities that receive new parks and transit funding
  reflect the diversity of Los Angeles and that funding resources go to
  communities that have been historically under-resourced. The broader impact of
  our proposal is to reduce health inequities and improve health because an
  engaged citizenry can advocate for its community’s needs. Our program can help
  residents of these communities be prepared for the advocacy that will be
  necessary to ensure equitable public funding for parks, open space, and
  transit investment in their communities. 
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Communications support
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
