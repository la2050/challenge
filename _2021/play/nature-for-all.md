Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Nature For All’s mission is to work to build a diverse base of support for
  ensuring that everyone in the Los Angeles area —no matter where they live—has
  equitable access to the wide range of benefits that nature can provide.
project_description: >-
  All Aboard for Nature will provide equitable and sustainable access to Los
  Angeles’ natural areas for targeted low-income families to our local
  mountains, regional parks, and beaches. We will provide a total of 10 free
  trips to Los Angeles’ natural areas and interpretive programming to more than
  500 community members without access to a vehicle or public transportation,
  many of whom will visit our nearby public lands for the first time.
  Participants will be able to improve their physical and mental well-being by
  having access to nature.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  A recent survey finds the pandemic negatively impacts our long-term physical
  and mental health (undesired weight changes, changes in sleep patterns,
  delayed health care, and worsened stress and mental health). Access to nature
  helps us cope and heal. According to numerous experts, nature is an effective
  way to shake off the weight and hardships associated with stay-at-home orders
  and social isolation. Yet, Los Angeles communities and populations hit hardest
  by the pandemic are also the ones with least access to open space and parks.
  Only five existing transit lines serve any of Los Angeles’ mountain open space
  destinations; only 22% of the County lives within one-half mile of bus stops
  or routes that service beach parks; and it takes one hour or more for 60% of
  residents to get to the mountains. More than 90% of our participants (who are
  low-income residents) cite transportation as their greatest barrier to
  accessing nature. Our pandemic recovery requires equity in access to nature.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  All Aboard for Nature will provide a total of 10 free trips to Los Angeles’
  natural areas and interpretive programming to more than 500 community members,
  with priority outreach to communities and populations most impacted by lack of
  access to natural spaces such as those living in East LA, the San Gabriel
  Valley, and the San Fernando Valley, many of whom will visit them for the
  first time. These very/high-park-need communities (defined by LAC Parks and
  Recreation needs assessment) are often urban, predominantly low-income, &
  people of color, and lack convenient and affordable transportation options. We
  also will focus on reaching system-impacted and frontline communities
  (formerly incarcerated, foster youth, factory workers, etc). Organizations
  serving system-impacted and frontline communities will help us with outreach.
  Trips will be to natural areas within 1-1 ½ hours from their homes to forests,
  beaches, and parks and ensure options for people of all abilities. Each trip
  includes a naturalist to guide the group & provide education/safety. Our
  materials will be available in multiple languages, and the naturalists will be
  bilingual. If COVID restrictions are in place, we will provide 45 trips using
  micro-transit vouchers or passenger vans for transportation. Families will be
  met at the destination by a California Naturalist using COVID guidelines to
  orient them to hiking trails and other natural features. Approximately 405
  people will be served by these COVID-safe trips.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  This project addresses “Parks with intergenerational play opportunities”
  because natural lands and open spaces are places where all generations can
  enjoy recreational and educational activities; “Prevalence of trauma and
  adverse childhood experiences” because of nature’s healing and relaxation
  qualities; and “Obesity” because it is often a collaralary outcome for those
  that do not have access to play or nature. N4A will develop and use surveys
  and interviews to capture both quantitative and qualitative measures of our
  success. The survey will measure the number of people who participated, if
  they had a positive or beneficial experience on their access trip, what was
  learned, and if they show an interest in continuing to visit natural areas.
  Our program’s survey results show that over 82.8% surveyed state
  transportation is their biggest barrier to accessing nature (second was lack
  of information). Supervisor Sheila Kuehl committed to providing one shuttle
  per year for District 3.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  A recent article in an AARP newsletter led with this statement: When your
  world gets small, nature lets you live large. Los Angeles will be a more
  healthy and equitable place to live if our work is successful. Those hardest
  hit by the pandemic’s physical impacts and stresses will have access to Los
  Angeles’ public lands to be able to connect with nature and find relief and
  healing from a traumatic time. They will be able to do so safely by being with
  their families socially distanced outdoors. They will learn about Los Angeles’
  green spaces and be inspired to incorporate natural spaces into their lives
  and to want to learn how to advocate for increased local green space
  development, protection of nature, and more public transportation to the
  larger natural areas around Los Angeles for the future.
