Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  The mission of the USC Sol Price Center for Social Innovation is to develop
  ideas and illuminate strategies to improve the quality of life for people in
  low-income, urban communities.
project_description: >
  We propose expanding the Neighborhood Data for Social Change Criminal Justice
  Data Initiative to Santa Monica and Long Beach, to promote deeper
  understanding of—and engagement with—crime data region-wide. 


  This project will collect, clean and publish public safety data from law
  enforcement agencies; host free, publicly accessible monthly trainings;
  conduct community listening sessions; and co-produce data stories in
  partnership with CBOs. This project will help all Angelenos enjoy safe
  neighborhoods and safe places to play by 2050.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to PLAY
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Westside
  - South Bay
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  LA residents lack access to most neighborhood-level public safety data. The
  inability to access data and lack of knowledge around criminal justice issues
  that impact communities have critical implications for evidence-based
  policymaking, community engagement, and constructive dialogue among law
  enforcement, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and independent
  civic actors. In turn, this impacts the safety, accessibility, and vibrancy of
  LA neighborhoods.


  Additionally, individuals also often lack trust in law enforcement systems
  designed to facilitate public safety and engender confidence through
  supporting strong communities. This lack of trust has emerged through a long
  and complex history between marginalized communities and law enforcement, but
  has been exacerbated by the lack of access to data, and absence of resulting
  collaborative dialogue.


  To bridge these divides, all stakeholders must have access to—and an
  understanding of—current and relevant public safety data.
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >-
  The Price Center has a proven track record of democratizing neighborhood-level
  data using the NDSC platform, which is a free, publicly available online
  resource for civic actors in LA County to learn about their neighborhoods.
  NDSC illuminates the trends, challenges, and opportunities facing LA County
  neighborhoods by curating and disseminating neighborhood-level (down to the
  census tract) data across ten policy areas.
   
  It also utilizes narrative storytelling as a tool for social change. For
  example, we have provided a powerful vehicle for awareness and advocacy
  through conducting listening sessions to help residents conceptualize how
  crime data is relevant for their own communities.


  Given its expertise in neighborhood data and relationships with community
  stakeholders, the Price Center is uniquely positioned to effectively implement
  this project focused on expanding LA County residents’ access to and
  understanding of public safety trends within the region.
What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: >-
  The Price Center will measure project success through tracking the following:
   
  Data Aggregation: In collaboration with our partners, the Price Center will
  identify law enforcement agencies in two LA County jurisdictions to obtain,
  clean, and upload public safety data by census tract. Data may include arrests
  and call for services, among other datasets.


  Community Engagement: NDSC has received over 330,000 page visits since
  launching in 2017; we will continue to track website views. NDSC will scale up
  activities to include criminal justice work, in order to reach 450,000
  Angelenos over the next year. Working with community stakeholders and law
  enforcement agencies, we will conduct a series of community listening sessions
  to ensure residents’ voices inform the proposed data efforts.
   
  Trainings: We will host 12 free community trainings specific to accessing and
  understanding datasets related to crime and public safety. Content will be
  promoted on the NDSC platform, in a monthly newsletter, and on the NDSC
  Twitter handle, which shares training schedules, new datasets, and new data
  stories. We will also track the number of individuals and organizations who
  attend these trainings.


  Data Stories: We will publish two data stories focused on trends, challenges,
  and opportunities related to crime and public safety, co-produced with law
  enforcement agencies and CBOs that work in the broader landscape. Data stories
  are published in partnership with NDSC media partner, KCETLink.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '563068'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '10200000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  By expanding NDSC’s public safety data, this project will support vibrant and
  safe communities regionally. NDSC recently added arrest and stop rate data for
  the City of LA, which provides rich data for advocates, law enforcement
  agencies, and policy makers. Such data is needed for a wider set of
  geographies. By incorporating additional datasets, and increasing data access
  through trainings, listening sessions, and community outreach, NDSC will
  facilitate increased knowledge of crime rates, positive perceptions of
  neighborhood safety, and support healthier communities.


  Further, by providing support to CBOs focused on park access and neighborhood
  safety, this project will help organizations better execute their missions.
'Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.': >
  The Price Center has partnered with a wide variety of law enforcement agencies
  and community-based organizations through NDSC, since launching the platform
  in 2017. We have worked in close collaboration with LAPD, the Community
  Coalition in South Los Angeles, the Urban Peace Institute, and the GRYD
  Foundation (Gang Reduction and Youth Development), among others.
   
  In addition, the NDSC Steering Committee represents a multitude of
  organizations in Los Angeles, including the Southeast Los Angeles (SELA)
  Collaborative, Coalition for Responsible Community Development, South Los
  Angeles Transit-Empowerment Zone (SLATE-Z), and the Housing Authority of LA.
