Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  A Place Called Home provides a safe, nurturing environment with proven
  programs in arts, education and wellness for young people in South Central Los
  Angeles to help them improve their economic conditions and develop healthy,
  fulfilling and purposeful lives. 
project_description: >-
  A Place Called Home will help improve mental health and wellness outcomes for
  1,000 youth in South Central LA with a wraparound approach encompassing
  physical and socioemotional health, nutrition, family dynamic and function,
  and educational support. Our program team works closely with our counselors
  and clinicians to ensure that youths’ daily care and learning experiences are
  informed by trauma awareness and focused on healing. By providing
  individualized support, we will help underserved youth in South Central live
  their best lives.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Mental health is a multifaceted aspect of wellness affected by many factors.
  At A Place Called Home, we take them all into account. We are based in one of
  the most impoverished neighborhoods in South LA, where 40% of residents over
  age 25 have less than a 9th grade education and fewer than 4% have Bachelor’s
  degrees. Of members reporting income, 87% live at or below the federal poverty
  line. Our community is primarily Latinx. Residents face high rates of violence
  and drug use, growing homelessness, underperforming schools, and limited
  access to healthy food and safe recreational space – all leading to increases
  in childhood substance abuse, conduct disorders and elevated dropout rates.
  Per the National Council for Behavioral Health, people of color encounter
  significant disparities accessing mental health resources and increased
  stigma. The National Institutes of Health report that Latinos experience
  socioeconomic barriers because of language, acculturation and immigration
  status. 
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >-
  A Place Called Home is distinctive for its holistic “Whole Child” approach
  addressing multiple areas of need to improve wellness, from physical and
  mental health to food insecurity to socioemotional development. For 26 years,
  we have provided linguistically and culturally accessible services to youth
  members and their families. To build trust and ensure relevancy and
  relatability, our staff reflects the ethnic and cultural diversity of our
  constituent community. More than a third of our program and administrative
  staff live in South Los Angeles, including our Executive Director. Our staff
  includes trained bilingual mental health professionals and case managers
  (Spanish/English). APCH was founded in the aftermath of the 1992 LA riots, and
  we have decades of experience working closely with a community in crisis.
  Since inception, we have served more than 20,000 youth and families and
  another 150,000 community members through supportive services and neighborhood
  events. 
What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: >-
  We are living through a public health crisis. Supporting the long-term mental
  health and wellness of underserved children is more important than ever. By
  the end of the year, A Place Called Home will provide 20,000 hours of free
  individualized mental health and family services in Spanish and English, serve
  34,000 meals on site and distribute 3,000 bags of groceries to food insecure
  families, and serve 1,000 unduplicated youth. In addition to one-on-one
  therapy, we will work with parents/guardians and youth to support healthy
  dynamics at home. We will provide case management services to help families
  access the resources they need. Participants will show better self-regulation,
  better communication skills, reduced interpersonal conflict and improved
  conflict resolution skills, and improvement in academic outcomes. We collect
  data regularly by survey to measure behavioral outcomes, and maintain case
  management files to evaluate impacts. Long-term success at A Place Called Home
  means that: 1) members have increased capacity for prosocial, non-prejudicial
  and nonviolent interaction with peers, teachers, other adults, family and
  community members; 2) increased likelihood that members will remain in school,
  graduate, and go on to pursue higher learning and/or meaningful employment; 3)
  reduced likelihood of involvement in the juvenile justice system; and 4)
  members can take full ownership of their lives, and feel empowered to make a
  difference in their communities and in the world. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '1000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '10000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Current evidence suggests that low-income communities like ours will be the
  hardest hit by the Coronavirus pandemic. In addition to the greater economic
  impacts to the region, the closing of LAUSD schools means that low-income
  neighborhoods will experience more negative downstream effects because
  families rely on school infrastructure for multiple services. Our community
  also includes a high number of undocumented families facing additional
  barriers to services because of language and immigration status. A Place
  Called Home will be critical to filling the gaps in the social safety net in
  South LA, particularly for families who are not eligible for federal benefits
  through the CARES Act, by providing direct services and making referrals.

  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
