Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Our mission is to be an organization devoted to healing and centered on
  individual wellness and community, to be an advocate for those in Hollywood
  without shelter, and to lead and collaborate with others to develop and
  implement solutions that lead to resilience and housing.
project_description: >-
  The Center believes that the biggest barrier to housing for individuals
  experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles today is the isolation that comes
  from living on the streets. Utilizing a cutting edge engagement model that
  prioritizes building genuine relationships over transactional interactions,
  staff are able to garner the trust of service-resistant folks and connect them
  to mental health treatment, physical health care, and ultimately to
  sustainable housing interventions.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  On any given day, more than 125 individuals access The Center’s facility to
  attend groups, connect over cups of coffee, or to seek resources offered by
  The Center and by a dozen partner providers. While the agency hosts multiple
  publicly funded contracts, the privately funded Community Wellness programming
  is the heart of The Center, and is designed to be a resource for both the
  housed and unhoused community. Currently The Center’s Community Wellness
  programming is fully supported through private donations. The organization's
  biggest challenge, which was exacerbated through the pandemic, is securing
  unrestricted operating support for these programs. In 2020, The Center lost
  $500,000 in private funding. Programs that focus on wellness for unhoused
  clients, such as the On-Site Clinic, mail service, and wellness groups, as
  well as programs that focus on housing retention for those already in housing,
  such as Flourishing in Housing, will be the focal point of LA2050 grant
  funding.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  In order to fulfill the agency's mission of ending isolation and homelessness,
  The Center facilitates programming that assists individuals with
  decompressing, feeling safe, and overcoming social isolation. The goal of
  these groups is to re-engage individuals with years of trauma back into
  community life. The Center has found that when a person is immersed in safe,
  consistent community they are much more likely to seek case management, obtain
  housing, and maintain that housing. Regular programming runs the gamut from
  group meditation, to yoga (led by volunteer yogis from Wanderlust), art,
  poetry and music classes, read aloud short stories and current events, and
  gardening groups. On Friday’s, the agency invites only female-identifying
  folks to enter the facility, with the understanding that those with
  gendered-trauma thrive in the safety of closed community groups. In 2017, the
  Community Wellness Program staff launched Flourishing in Housing, which took
  the ethos of the Community Wellness Program and applied it specifically to
  people who obtained housing but who continued to seek support at The Center.
  With the Flourishing in Housing program, The Center utilizes an innovative
  model focused on housing retention. It does this by breaking isolation through
  engagement and encouragement, while providing job and volunteer readiness
  training and support. The goal of this group is to improve and maintain
  housing retention to ultimately break the cycle of homelessness for good.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  While there are thousands of agencies dedicated to homelessness in LA, The
  Center utilizes a radically different approach to solve the problem. Community
  Wellness programming gets results by focusing on relationships rather than
  transactional interactions. Daily groups provide the unhoused a safe place to
  re-engage with society. By reconnecting to the greater community, folks are
  able to pursue permanent housing. For recently housed clients, The Center
  offers Flourishing in Housing. This is a program unique to The Center, as
  there are no partner agencies supporting with housing retention in a similar
  capacity. Participants in this program don’t just retain their housing; they
  thrive in housing. They learn how to be active members of the community with a
  sense of purpose and belonging. In 2020, the program boasted a 90% retention
  rate, with over 70 participants and just one full-time staff member. With
  funding to continue to expand these programs, these numbers will only
  increase.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '3628744'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Homelessness is arguably the leading crisis facing Los Angeles today. On any
  given night, there are 48,000 people living on the street and another 18,000
  staying in congregate shelter facilities. Even more concerning is that these
  numbers are up by 13% from 2019 homeless count data. If this trend continues
  unbridled, by 2050 there will be upwards of 325,000 individuals experiencing
  homelessness in Los Angeles.  If The Center is awarded LA2050 grant funding,
  there will be less than 10,000 people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles
  county by 2050. In the long-term, The Center aims to meet this goal by
  drastically (but sustainably!) scaling-up their unique programming model so
  that the housing success their clients benefit from can be experienced
  exponentially throughout Los Angeles. In the short-term, The Center plans to
  expand Wellness programming to help unhoused clients move towards housing, and
  to diversify Flourishing in Housing programming to keep housed clients housed.
