'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The City of Los Angeles (LA) released the Health Atlas for the City of Los
  Angeles (Health Atlas), a report that compared health outcomes and social
  determinants across neighborhoods to address important elements contributing
  to the health of LA. They determined that Watts faces the poorest health
  outcomes and social determinants with limited access to resources compared to
  affluent LA neighborhoods.  Watts is perpetually constructed as an underserved
  community with low-performing schools, inadequate health care, poor housing,
  and high unemployment that impact community health; residents experience the
  poorest health outcomes.  Watts is a dense community with 70% of residents
  Latino and 28% African-American. 30% of Watts residents live in poverty and
  households continually experience unemployment/underemployment. Watts Rising
  is focused on turning around these stark statistics through resident-informed
  investment in the physical environment, local jobs, education, and
  entrepreneurism.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Funds from the LA2050 grant will support our Watts Rising Street Team (WRST),
  a group of resident ambassadors in Watts who focus on community engagement,
  trust-building and adaption and utilization of new community investments. One
  of the primary goals of the Watts Rising Collaborative is the creation and
  implementation of a meaningful and transformative Community Engagement
  Strategy, to ensure that as many Watts residents as possible are informed
  about and thereby able to take advantage of the various opportunities provided
  as a part of Watts Rising and provide input on the design of our programs and
  projects. The WRST is also about building local capacity, offering Street Team
  members the ability to establish themselves as consultants, providing them
  with a platform for additional work in or outside their community using their
  learned engagement, marketing and leadership skills.   Together, the WRST
  supports these twenty six projects which have the goals of (1) reducing local
  sources of air pollution; (2) improving public health outcomes and addressing
  health disparities; (3) preventing displacement and its impact on physical and
  mental health; (4) address and mitigate non-GHG sources and exposure to
  pollution; and (5) create safe and secure public spaces. A few of our projects
  to target these goals include: creating a fully electric local bus line,
  providing an electric car sharing program, installing solar roofing for family
  homes, and developing a major urban park.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Watts Rising is currently working with three institutions of higher learning,
  USC, UCLA and Charles Drew University on various studies and indicator
  tracking over the next four years that will assess the impact of the
  initiative on the health and environment of Watts. Each project funded is
  being tracked on its measurable deliverables and secondary outcomes.   Some of
  the important indicators we are tracking include:  (1) Reducing Local Sources
  Of Air Pollution: Metrics will be tracked with a community-wide survey on
  household behaviors, traffic counts, and participation in shared fleet and
  weatherization programs.  (2) Improving public health outcomes and addressing
  health disparities:  Annual community surveys will track goals of increased
  daily physical activity, healthy eating habits and improved perceptions of
  individual and community health as determined by resident engagement with
  Watts Rising projects.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '3000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Considering various local reports on community health, Watts is usually within
  the most underserved and under-resourced areas.  Service Planning Area 6,
  which includes Watts, has the County’s lowest educational attainment, highest
  unemployment and poverty rate, and limited language proficiency and homicide
  is the leading cause of premature death posing a critical question related to
  social determinants of health.   Watts Rising’s partners are focused on
  environmental investments to combat asthma, heart disease and the effects of
  industrial contaminants & provide affordable healthy food; pathways to
  employment and entrepreneurism to promote economic equity; and creation of a
  community of health through walking and biking clubs as well as support for
  Safe Routes to School and parent clubs. Watts is working together to move from
  having the lowest life expectancy in the County to the highest.
