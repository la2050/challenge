project_description: >-
  USGBC-LA is launching a Healthy Building Alliance for the L.A. Region to
  create a commitment that building owners, tenants, & individuals can make to
  provide healthy, resilient space to live, work, & play. It entails 5 simple
  principles around building & occupant health: Indoor Air Quality, Inspire
  Movement, Access to Nature, Green Cleaning, & Water Testing. The goal: create
  commitment, generate valuable data, & provide resources to support the journey
  for all Angelenos to experience healthy environments.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >
  Property owners generally want to provide healthy spaces, especially when they
  see the data on increased long-term asset value, but the current rating
  systems & engagement process are too complicated & expensive to produce scaled
  impact. The COVID-19 crisis highlights the need for better monitoring systems,
  improved air quality, & to provide healthier, more resilient spaces. There is
  also a dramatic need for data around indoor air & local water quality,
  especially in multi-family buildings in DACs to build the case to channel
  funding to these communities. Greater evidence links poorly constructed,
  maintained & located housing to many health conditions, including asthma, lead
  poisoning & mental health issues, as well as more ER visits &
  hospitalizations. Healthier buildings focus more on energy efficiency & water
  conservation, lowering utility bills. Families who struggle to make rent, move
  frequently or experience homelessness, face a much greater risk of adverse
  health outcomes. 
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >
  USGBC-LA has a proven reputation for excellence, impact, environmental
  behavior & cultural change, through outreach, education, program management, &
  community-based projects: Health & Wellness training helps LA lead in healthy
  building certifications, there is a huge gap in affordable & market-rate
  multi-family housing; Green Janitor Education Program certifies janitorial
  workers in office buildings in principles of green cleaning, energy
  efficiency, & water conservation (1,400+ empowered grads, & with buildings
  show a 5.6% average energy reduction); we facilitate sustainability &
  resilience training/workshops across LA helping small businesses build
  capacity, identify no/low cost ways to save energy & water; provide
  benchmarking support for building owners to help comply with the City’s EBEWE
  ordinance; assist homeowners with sustainable rebuilding post-wildfires; &
  promote sustainability in under-served communities through annual Legacy
  Project granted to local community groups.
What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: >
  Ultimate success for the Healthy Building Alliance is to provide healthy
  spaces for all Angelenos to live, work, & play in. We need to create a low
  barrier to entry experience for people to learn about their spaces: current
  condition, how they impact personal health, and how to improve them. Our
  project is data driven by an underlying principle that once people have access
  to data & an understanding of what it means, they will work to improve the
  results, especially when it involves the health of themselves & their
  families. Our project will collect data through Tenant Surveys, Indoor Air
  Quality Sensors, & Water Testing. Success will be determined by incremental
  improvements against the baseline. While all types of spaces can make a
  commitment to health through the Alliance, we will start with affordable
  housing to shine a light at the heart of the equity issue in the built
  environment. There’s a need for data on these buildings to demonstrate that
  often poorly built and maintained multi-family properties need increased
  investment, and we will provide a toolkit for owners, operators, and
  developers to improve tenant heath through building systems, maintenance, and
  materials. Success for us through this funding will be to launch the program;
  produce successful pilots with a minimum of 5 properties in DAC’s in LA
  County, with at least one specifically in South LA, East LA, & the Eastern San
  Fernando Valley; release of a toolkit for participants going forward; & the
  program experiencing organic growth during this timeframe. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '750'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '15000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >
  The program goal is to create a local movement around providing healthy space
  and raise awareness around how the health of our spaces impacts us all
  personally. Direct impact - 5 pilot projects at avg 50 units = 250 units at
  avg 3 family members per unit = 750 people directly impacted. USGBC-LA will
  target large affordable housing owner operators at 1,000+ units = 5,000 units
  and 15,000 occupants indirect impact. This program will help parents provide a
  healthier environment for their children, reducing financial costs, & burden
  to the family & healthcare providers. The deliverables will become a toolkit
  to better the health of the tenant population, potentially as part of
  financing requirements for affordable housing across the region. 
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
  - 'Office space for meetings, events, or for staff'
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: ''
Which metrics will you impact?:
  - Housing affordability
  - Air quality
  - Resilient communities
