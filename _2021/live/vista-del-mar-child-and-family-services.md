Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Vista Del Mar provides comprehensive, family-centered social, educational, and
  behavioral health services, which encourage children, adolescents and their
  families to lead self-reliant, stable, and productive lives.
project_description: >-
  Vista Del Mar provides counseling and case management services throughout the
  Greater Los Angeles Area. More than 80% of our clients are from low-income
  households, and do not have the means to travel to our campus in West Los
  Angeles for face-to-face therapy. While online therapy provides an opportunity
  for us to reach these clients, we must first upgrade our technology to enable
  us to provide video counseling and other online services.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - South Bay
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The need for mental health services continues to expand at an alarming rate.
  In 2018, a study by the National Council for Behavioral Health showed that not
  only is American experiencing a mental health crisis, but that the lack of
  access to care is a root cause of that crisis. Low-income families suffer the
  most from this epidemic, not only because they cannot afford to pay for
  services, but because they do not have physical access to these services.
  Vista Del Mar offers high-quality, evidence-based mental health services on
  our West Los Angeles campus to more than 1,000 clients per year, without
  regard for their ability to pay. Our clients come from all over the Greater
  Los Angeles area, from some of the most under-resourced communities. Knowing
  that online therapy is the wave of the future, Vista has already begun to
  offer online therapy; however, our antiquated phone system is a barrier to the
  growth of this program because it cannot accommodate VoIP or streaming video.
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >-
  For more than a century, Vista Del Mar has been an innovative leader in caring
  for children and families in need. We were the first to establish a
  cottage-style orphanage in Southern California, to incorporate the nascent
  foster care system into our services, and to identify the mental health
  challenges children in Los Angeles faced following World War II. We also built
  one of only two Level 14+ (24/7 supervised care) mental health facilities for
  severely disturbed children in California. Our clinical programs have been
  awarded a Gold Seal by the Joint Commission, the highest level of
  accreditation possible, and our educational facilities are fully accredited by
  the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). We have been a major
  front-line provider of mental health services in Los Angeles for decades; as
  such, this program represents a natural evolution of our services.
What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: >-
  Success for this project will be defined by our ability to provide online
  therapy services remotely to any client in Los Angeles who needs it. Our
  on-campus telephone switching system will have been upgraded to accommodate
  high volume VoIP so that any number of clients can be served simultaneously,
  if need be. Our therapists, as well as our clients, will have the necessary
  equipment and expertise to utilize this service as required.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '1000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '5000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Thousands of people across Los Angeles need mental health services but are
  unable to access those services due to inability to travel. By providing
  mental health services remotely, we can eliminate that barrier. Mental health
  is a major cause of abuse, addiction, violence and homelessness. With more
  people receiving the mental health services they need, fewer children will be
  abused, fewer people will lose their jobs or self-medicate due to mental
  illness, and fewer people will become homeless as a result of these problems.
  Studies show that online therapy services cost less than face-to-face
  treatment and requires less of a therapist's time, meaning therapists can
  treat more people online than they can in-person.
