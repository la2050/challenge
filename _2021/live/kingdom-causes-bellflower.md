Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  Our mission is to be a catalyst that inspires, connects, and mobilizes people
  towards personal and community transformation.  
project_description: >-
  Through increased volunteer mobilization, Kingdom Causes Bellflower will
  launch a life skills program called “Strong Neighbors” for homeless and
  low-income neighbors. The program will empower people through workshops with
  topics like money management, life transitions, outdoor survival,
  self-defense, waste management, employment and increasing income, authority
  interaction, organization of belongings, and property law. Classes will equip
  individuals with skills to help cope with life on the street, as well as
  increase preparedness for housing. 
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  People who struggle with homelessness face many barriers. These barriers
  include affordable housing, deficient job opportunities, addictions, mental
  health difficulties, and lack of supportive communities. Overcoming barriers
  often requires long-term solutions. While it is valuable to prioritize major
  obstacles, there is value in addressing practical lifestyle gaps. Life skills
  classes give neighbors a chance to discover new abilities and put knowledge
  towards individual growth. By addressing lifestyle and environment, residents
  build on their likelihood of success. The use of an expanded volunteer program
  increases the investment of broader society in community development.
  Transformation for our homeless and low-income neighbors will result in
  housing retention and increase their contribution to the community. The
  “Strong Neighbors” program will allow development of needed skills to obtain
  and retain housing, while providing support that cannot be fully offered by
  case management.
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >-
  Kingdom Causes Bellflower (KCB) helps people get off the street, provides
  support services to those at risk of homelessness, creates pathways to
  sustainable work through social enterprise, and offers training and education
  to the community. KCB inspires, equips, and mobilizes hundreds of volunteers
  each year from churches, businesses, city leadership, service clubs, and other
  non-profit organizations. By balancing services, partnerships, and ongoing
  community dialogue, KCB maintains a philosophy that all of us are better than
  any of us. KCB dreams of a flourishing community where everyone has a place to
  live, a place to work, and a place to belong. KCB was founded in 2001 by
  residents who desired collaborative solutions to the tangible challenges
  facing low-income families. Today, KCB is an experienced homeless services
  provider but also utilizes existing neighborhood resources, facilitates
  strategic conversations, and seeks solutions that maximize community
  investment.
What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: >-
  Kingdom Causes Bellflower (KCB) has been mobilizing volunteers for many years,
  but that responsibility has often been shared by a number of staff members and
  other community individuals who give of their time. The goal of this proposal
  is to streamline and expand the volunteering process so that a comprehensive
  collection of training opportunities can be created, implemented, and
  evaluated for long-term effectiveness. 


  In 2019, KCB recruited, trained, and mobilized 279 volunteers, which included
  2,078 hours of donated work. Since one industry standard (1) values the
  volunteer hour at $25.43, KCB leveraged almost $53,000 in savings for the
  organization in 2019. Volunteers play a vital role in supporting staff-driven
  programs and addressing the philosophy of KCB that long-term development must
  be embraced and owned by the entire community. Success for this program would
  be measured by seeing 12 educational opportunities planned and implemented in
  2020 and 2021. Written and verbal feedback will be solicited from both
  facilitators and participants. Attendees will be offered additional
  opportunities for support, and their participation in the program will be
  correlated with case management metrics as appropriate, including housing and
  employment. Success for the volunteer mobilization aspect of this program will
  be for KCB to see an increase of volunteers from 270 to 350. This increase in
  volunteers will provide additional evidence of community involvement in the
  support of at-risk neighbors.

Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '150'

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The population served by Kingdom Causes Bellflower (KCB) is the low-income
  residents of Bellflower, California, though the organization also serves
  residents from surrounding cities in Los Angeles County. These cities include
  Artesia, Cerritos, Compton, Downey, Lynwood, Norwalk, and Paramount. Our
  proposal will provide practical, developmental skills for 150 individuals who
  are homeless or at-risk of homelessness. There will be 12 different
  educational opportunities, and emphasis will be placed on recruiting a
  diversity of volunteer facilitators, including formerly homeless individuals.
  The indirect impact will encompass the larger constituency of KCB, and include
  aspects of awareness and opportunities for volunteering.
