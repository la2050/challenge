Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South Bay
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  San Pedro Meals on Wheels has been a successful program since 1972, serving
  approximately 1.5 million people to date.  The San Pedro senior population,
  the number of people with chronic illnesses and people recuperating following
  a hospital stay are groups which are all growing exponentially.  The services
  available to serve these people in our community is limited, not keeping up
  with the demand and must be expanded.  This organization relies on donations
  to meet operating budget goals.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  San Pedro Meals on Wheels has proven it's success throughout the years,
  including receiving the Chamber of Commerce Non Profit of the Year Award in
  2018.  We have the facilities and overall capacity to grow and serve many more
  people than we currently serve.  We have the support of a strong Board of
  Directors, a helpful community and loving, caring volunteers.  With the
  financial backing, we can prepare and deliver many more meals throughout the
  San Pedro and neighboring communities.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Depending on the date funding is received, we will increase the number of
  people served, the number of meals prepared and served and the number of
  community volunteers utilized to expand San Pedro Meals on Wheels services. 
  These number will be easily accessible and shared.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '200'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '56000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Currently client average of 40/day.  Projected clients 200/day.  Currently San
  Pedro population is approximately 56,000.  Word of mouth and social media will
  spread regarding the additional program success and reach the entire
  community.

  Reusable and recyclable containers will be researched and added to the
  program.

  Personal interaction with people confined to their home is a daily
  occurrence.  Additional programs developed to assist these people in creating
  simple craft products to donate to other organizations in need in the
  community.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >+
