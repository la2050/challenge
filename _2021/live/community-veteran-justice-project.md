Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  CVJP helps veterans by breaking the cycle of incarceration via early
  intervention and by promoting the use of under-utilized California veteran
  alternative sentencing statutes. While helping our clients with their criminal
  cases, we also connect them to community support and mental health services.
project_description: >-
  This grant will allow us to expand assistance to LA area Veterans and their
  families by ensuring our Veteran clients receive the maximum benefit from the
  California Veteran alternative sentencing statutes.  We will enhance our
  outreach to ensure maximum awareness among veterans who are in legal trouble
  while enhancing our educational programs for California defense attorneys.
  These attorneys often need assistance in applying the statues that were
  specifically designed to help break the cycle of veteran incarceration,
  homelessness, and suicide.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  While the assistance we provide to Veterans involved in LA County’s justice
  system is significant, we reach only a fraction of those eligible. Annually,
  approximately 10,000 service members transition home into LA County, but many
  struggle to adjust to civilian life. PTSD and other stresses have devastating
  effects on this population. 20 American heroes take their lives daily, only 3
  are under the care of the VA; rates of veteran drug abuse and homelessness in
  LA Country are just as unacceptable. PTSD and mental health conditions are
  closely linked to legal problems for veterans, but the military has instilled
  a culture of not asking for help. Unfavorable legal outcomes for Veterans in
  LA County are a strong indicator of future problems and a downward spiral for
  this population. California legislators recognized these issues and
  implemented strong alternative sentencing statutes of which veterans are
  largely unaware and defense attorneys are often ill-prepared to implement. 
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >-
  We are uniquely suited to take on the issue of breaking the chain of veteran
  incarceration, homeless and substance abuse because we are an up and running
  organization providing these services every day here in LA Country.  We have
  helped more than 640 Veterans seek diversion and alternative sentencing under
  the California statutes while also connecting Vets to other essential
  services.  Our reach is extensive with 17 local College Veteran Resources
  Center partners referring their student Veterans. We train hundreds of
  court-appointed and private attorneys to gain favorable outcomes, keeping our
  Vets out of the worst part of our legal system. This leverage among these
  influential groups is key to our success as we have been able to reach Vets in
  need and the attorney advocates, but we are also straining under this growth. 
  Our dedication of purpose will allow this proven model to expand to meet the
  growing need – for the benefit of the Vet and the entire community.
What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: >-
  We define success by the number of Veterans we help navigate the complex LA
  Country criminal justice system, while referring then to vital mental health
  services. During our first year (10/17-10/18), we averaged helping 10 Veterans
  per month. This average grew to approx. 20 per month over the next 9 months
  and now averages about 38 per month.  Clearly the growth trajectory is
  accelerating and unsustainable without additional funding. We will measure
  success by maintaining growth at a rate where we will be able to consistently
  provide help to at least 50 Veterans per month. An additional measure of our
  success will be achieving the goal of making training available to the more
  than 1,000 LA country court-appointed attorneys and the many private attorneys
  on proper usage of the California diversion and alternative sentencing
  statutes.  We also have set a goal to automate our website, intake forms,
  referral process and to establish an automated process to identify the most
  at-risk Veterans so that these individuals can be provided extra assistance,
  especially rapid referral to mental health services, and to better leverage
  our limited staff resources to meet our goal of helping an average of 50
  Veterans and Veteran families each month. Other successes are difficult to
  quantify especially relating to helping Veterans who are at major and
  immediate risk of major negative life events, but are nevertheless a critical
  component of the services we provide.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '360000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '10000000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Veterans are not only a distinct group but our friends and neighbors. LA
  County has more veterans than any other county in California, with about
  330,000.  Our veterans are 6 times more likely to commit suicide, up to 30%
  have experienced PTSD, and Veteran unemployment is 34% higher than the
  population. These numbers are even more dramatic for combat veterans. 
  Research proves it is the military service that has caused the disparity
  compared to the general population. Breaking the cycle of incarceration,
  homelessness, substance abuse and the deterioration of veteran family units is
  not only needed to benefit our communities, it pays a debt that is owed to
  these brave men and women who served our country in its time of need. 
'Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.': >-
  CVJP is not submitting a ‘collaborative proposal’ per se, as our efforts are
  highly collaborative with the veteran community. We serve as a focal point to
  marshal various resources to help the Los Angeles County veteran. CVJP is
  establishing the infrastructure throughout the county in collaboration with
  the Department of Health Services (DHS), Department of Mental Health, the
  Veterans Administration, the Public Defender’s Office and other entities to
  create this coordinated system for all justice-involved veterans. In addition
  we are working with US Vets housing, treatment and special women’s programs,
  LA County Military and Veteran Affairs, the UCLA legal clinic and Veteran
  Family Wellness Center, Region 7 College Veteran Resource Centers, and the Los
  Angeles Veteran Collaborative.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
  - 'Office space for meetings, events, or for staff'
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: ''
