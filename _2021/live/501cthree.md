Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  501CTHREE will mobilize the next generation to fight climate change by
  creating a global community that embraces low-carbon culture. This community
  will be built by intersecting YOUTH, TECHNOLOGY and STORYTELLING. 501CTHREE is
  focused on social justice and has a track record across the US.
project_description: >-
  We fill a gap not served in the market as a multi-dimensional media, climate
  technology deployment and job skills program. The deployment of the 501CTHREE
  Food and Water Box provides resources to the LA community and in turn empowers
  the community with workforce development skills.  501CTHREE utilizes
  storytelling around the tech deployment to amplify the scalable programs that
  other change-makers facing similar issues in struggling communities can learn
  from and apply.  501CTHREE is about environmental justice.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - South LA
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  We understand that historic and systematic barriers keep people of color from
  accessing things like voting, food & water but we also know that racial
  inequality doesn't stop there. The racial gaps go way deeper, multiplying
  injustice into lesser known areas (like clean energy and the internet) and
  harming the wellness, safety and success of millions of Black, LatinX and
  Indigenous people every day. "Race X" is about understanding the intersections
  between race and access everywhere, and taking action to change things, no
  matter how hard the challenge may seem.   Communities of color have been
  facing racial problems in the shadows for too long. Low income communities and
  communities of color disproportionally experience contaminated tap water. We
  saw this problem most notoriously in Flint, but contaminated drinking water is
  a problem throughout the country. According to studies, Black children are 3
  times more likely than white children to have elevated levels of lead in their
  blood.  
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  501CTHREE will use our voices, our platform and our resources to make an
  impact and empower people of color, starting at RaceX. The 501CTHREE Food and
  Water Box delivers fresh food and up to 20 gallons of clean water per minute
  and the program is designed in partnership with the community to multiply
  their food and water distribution efforts.   The goal of the Food and Water
  Justice campaign is to launch Food and Water Boxes in low income communities
  and communities of color that disproportionately experience contaminated
  water. 501CTHREE will introduce a new element of workforce development and
  job-skills training with the Food and Water Box. The community partners will
  learn the assembly and fabrication skills required to build and assemble the
  Food and Water Box and provide back to their own community. The program
  teaches key skills that workers need to enter an apprentice program across a
  variety of skilled trades and key mentorship for guidance and future
  opportunities. The program is designed to prepare people for the technical
  elements of an apprenticeship, teaching key skills including project planning,
  electrical assembly, mechanical assembly, plumbing & inventory management. 
  501CTHREE also builds a smart content series and emotional yet informative
  storytelling that will grab the attention of potential partners that want to
  get involved in the community while amplifying the program - ranging from
  equipment donations, college scholarships to career opportunities.

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The program's goal is for residents to adopt healthier food choices as part of
  their lifestyle which helps helps combat the symptoms of unclean water and
  improve overall health outcomes in food insecure communities.  As a culture of
  survival rooted in poverty encourages parents to purchase the cheapest
  available foods, which, living in a food desert, tend to be either
  pre-packaged or fast food. For families living below the Federal poverty line
  (ie $24,858 for a family of four), 30.8% are food insecure.  According to the
  our theory of change, programming will scale up and there will be improved
  community access to sustainable and climate-resilient solutions and in turn,
  improved health outcomes and workforce development. Also, as the community
  connects with opportunities to make a difference, a new generation will expect
  and demand sustainability and climate justice, and in turn there will be more
  investment in climate solutions research and job opportunities in climate
  change tech.
