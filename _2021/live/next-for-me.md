In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g., using a
  job recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing
  sites, applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college
  affordability to advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  More people are living longer, healthier lives, which lets them continue to
  work and contribute to the economy. There are more than 117 million Americans
  50 and older — 35 percent of the total population. Nearly two-thirds of
  40-somethings have less than $100,000 in retirement savings and 28% of those
  in their sixties have less than $50,000. For many a single medical emergency
  can wipe out those savings. For many, retirement is now a myth. The ability to
  adapt to a rapidly changing world is fundamental to financial survival. Our
  ability to adapt has been surpassed by the rate of technological change. This
  is especially challenging for workers over 50 who are facing age bias in the
  workplace already. Only 18% of diversity and inclusion programs include age as
  a factor. The skills to stay relevant must include agility with change.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Next For Me offers our books, courses, and workshops that address the mindset
  for change. Through in-person (when appropriate), online, and video the
  offering is free to anyone who wants to stay relevant in the workplace by
  adopting a growth mindset and agility in times of change.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  ~2,000 subscribers to a weekly newsletter 450+ articles, podcasts, videos and
  interviews 15+ cross country events 15+ partners in 50+ finance and work
  communities 4 courses with over 800 students to date
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2400'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '10000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  A generation of 50+ Los Angeles workers will have a set of skills to bring
  their wisdom to the workplace and be adaptive enough to stay relevant in their
  work.
