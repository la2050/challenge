  Utilizing a place-based, collective-impact approach to comprehensive community
  development, SCI provides a wide array of services and resources that help
  mitigate social, economic, health and environmental stressors that have
  historically caused barriers for LMI community members to fully thrive in
  their communities. As the cornerstone of SCI, the NHS Center for Sustainable
  Communities (CSC) serves as a “one-stop-shop” for community empowerment.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
  - Compton
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  For most LMI communities, steadily increasing housing costs and stagnant or
  decreasing incomes create barriers to achieving the community health equity.
  The economic instability faced by these communities prevents local residents
  from easily accessing dependable transit, healthy food, affordable homes and
  capital. Systemic barriers of historical discrimination, racism and classism
  have marginalized these disenfranchised communities and created an imbalance
  of power and privilege. The well-being of residents in LMI communities suffers
  from a lack of community investment, which inhibits development, limits access
  to employment, income, education and wealth.


  SCI partners are focused on developing a shared vision among residents and
  community stakeholders, and identifying key strategies for creating a more
  vibrant and equitable community for the residents of Compton and other LMI
  communities. The CSC is a space for healing the community trauma wrought from
  years of inequity. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  The SCI team is well-suited due to each of the organizations’ historic ability
  to serve as a catalyst in community development. Combining our work to have
  collective impact is the most effective path to achieve successful outcomes.
  NHS serves as the region’s largest affordable homeownership provider, having
  loaned, developed or rehabilitated more than 25,000 units. PCR is the largest
  SBDC in the region, serving more than 7,000 business clients with training,
  affordable business loans and 1:1 business coaching. Metro CDC in Compton for
  more than 25 years, has provided youth and family interventions, construction
  jobs for boys and men of color, creating urban gardens and social
  entrepreneurs. Watts Health Foundation has served the southeastern portion of
  the region for more than 50 years with low cost healthcare, and Alma Backyard
  Farms reconnects the lives of the formerly incarcerated back to the fabric of
  society through urban agriculture, gainful employment and job training
  programs. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "By 2020, NHS will have expanded its loan production by 15% and PCR by 15%. By 2021 NHS hopes to raise an additional $30 million in capital for program leverage, and by 2022 plans to enter escrow on 6 land banking sites for development near transit. \n\nOur partners envision that SCI will deliver a systemic, replicable model with programming and service delivery that can be utilized in similar LMI communities throughout the country. In order to achieve the desired long-term social impact that NHS envisions for the City of Compton, SCI’s objectives include: \n\n*\tBlight mitigation and comprehensive neighborhood revitalization\n*\tIncrease neighborhood investment and small business capital in TOD neighborhoods to connect residents to economic opportunity \n*\tSupport urban agricultural, agribusiness, and local farmers. Increase access to healthy foods to increase food security\n*\tDevelop greener mixed-use residential and commercial development in the neighborhood, acquire 6 additional blighted properties \n*\tIncrease social capital, improve quality of life in the community, preserve culture, heritage and legacy neighborhoods\n"
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '15000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '95000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  Public policies are often enacted under the guise of creating new public
  spaces, combatting blight, or bolstering economic development. But over time,
  these policies have stripped minority communities of the wealth and financial
  stability found in property ownership and owning small businesses. 


  A core component of SCI is providing access to the 99% minority population of
  Compton. Historically, minority LMI neighborhoods have been provided high
  cost, predatory loans for business and housing, poor health access, limited
  food options and have suffered educational disparities.  SCI is expanding
  opportunity by offering financial and business education, low cost, affordable
  loans and healthcare, urban agriculture, and workforce development.
