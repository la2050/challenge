Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  The Heart Touch Project is a nonprofit educational organization dedicated to
  the training and delivery of compassionate and healing touch to homebound or

project_description: >-
  The LA2050 Grants Challenge support would support Heart Touch to play an
  important role in filling the unmet need for non-pharmacological interventions
  for pain management in the healthcare system. As a leader in the field of
  massage therapy, Heart Touch is poised to lead the effort to train healthcare
  providers in non-pharmacological treatment strategies for those dealing with
  chronic pain. With your support, the LA-based Heart Touch will be able to lead
  the nation-wide effort to use compassionate touch therapy in filling this
  unmet need.
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE

    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  In search of a way to reduce and manage pain, many patients in the U.S. have
  turned to addictive prescription medications such as opioids, which reduce the
  intensity of pain. According to a CDC National Health Statistics (2019),
  almost 218,000 people died in the U.S. from overdoses related to prescription
  opioids from 1999 to 2017. 


  In response to the opioid epidemic, The Joint Commission, an independent
  non-profit organization that accredits and certifies nearly 21,000 health care
  organizations and programs in the U.S., introduced standards for organizations
  to improve their care for patients with pain. In August 2017, the Joint
  Commission published new and revised pain assessment and management standards
  that will now apply to all Joint Commission-accredited hospitals. The new
  standards require hospitals to provide patients with non-pharmacological pain
  treatment options, such as massage therapy. 
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >-
  Since 1995, Heart Touch has been at the forefront of a movement to bring
  therapeutic and mindful touch to health care and has become a national leader
  by integrating mindfulness and empathetic touch therapy into healthcare
  settings.


  Heart Touch has developed groundbreaking programs for children, seniors, and
  those with chronic, communicable and terminal illnesses. Heart Touch programs
  have been shown to help to manage chronic conditions, reduce pain and improve
  patient outcomes through the skillful deployment of proven mindful touch
  therapies provided by trained professionals who volunteer their time to serve
  those unable to afford these treatments.


  Since 1995, Heart Touch has trained more than 6,700 bodywork professionals,
  who have provided more than 23,000 free massages to thousands of the most
  vulnerable members of our community. Heart Touch has educated and certified
  more than 2,600 health care practitioners, who have provided thousands of
  hours of care to their patients.

  During the next two years, Heart Touch will provide trainings at four sites
  for new caregiver groups in Los Angeles. Heart Touch expects to train 520 RNs
  and CNAs over a period of two years. Heart Touch strives for both improved
