Describe the mission of your organization.: >-
  At SoCal 350, we envision equitable clean air and water and a stable climate
  through a fossil-fuel-free future, empowering our Southern California
  communities to join together for environmental, social, and economic justice.
project_description: >-
  With this grant, we seek to enhance our outreach, marketing, and staffing
  capabilities to have a greater impact on Southern California as a whole. Our
  priorities at this time include putting an end to neighborhood drilling
  throughout LA county, supporting the rights of indigenous groups, finding
  renewable energy solutions to fight climate change, putting pressure on Chase
  Bank to #stopthemoneypipeline that's destroying the Amazon, and
  educating/informing Angelenos about climate change via our podcast EcoJustice
  Radio. 
Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Did you know 580,000 Angelenos live within a quarter-mile of an active oil
  drilling site? JP Morgan Chase has provided $196 Billion in funding to fossil
  fuel companies since 2016. Individuals unemployed and lacking funds due to the
  Covid-19 pandemic may be at risk of eviction. These are just some of the
  issues that bounce around in the collective brain of SoCal 350 members. We're
  responding to a need throughout our community for information. We want to
  inspire and motivate residents to show their concern and raise their voices in
  hopes of enacting true change. We exist because we see the social,
  environmental, and economic issues facing the LA area and we want to do what
  we can to make things right. As a coalition, we partner with other
  organizations to spread the word, but with increased financial means we can
  create a name for ourselves and improve our ability to work with others, and
  spread information in an easy to understand and peaceful way. Collective
  voices are louder. 
Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.: >-
  As climate change activists, our group of volunteers believes in a clean
  energy future. We have a healthy mailing list and strong attendance at our
  meetings. We also have a rich history and vast network throughout Southern
  California as a collaborator when it comes to critical causes. We're uniquely
  positioned to mobilize other like-minded organizations and provide critical
  information to citizens in a friendly, peaceful way. 
What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?: >-
  The ultimate measure of success would be collaborating with residents and
  other organizations to stop neighborhood drilling in LA, protect the
  environment, and move toward a clean energy future. On a mission-based level,
  this would include growing our mailing list and social following, growing
  attendance at SoCal 350 meetings and creating a true sense of community that
  inspires and motivates on-going action, creating on-going partnerships with
  youth groups and like-minded activists, and being able to inform, educate, and
  mobilize the community in a way that puts pressure on government leaders to
  shut down neighborhood drill sites. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '580000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?: '10000000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Individuals who call LA county home deserve access to clean air and a healthy
  environment. At SoCal 350, our actions evolve as needs arise and new partners
  come to fruition, but our mission always remains set on a future free of
  fossil fuels with full employment. Following Covid-19, our goals may shift to
  ensure out of work residents have access to food and shelter. All this to say,
  the broader impact of supporting SoCal 350 is advocacy. We want LA to be a
  great place to live with clean air, fair wages, and the health and prosperity
  of citizens considered above all. If this means peaceful actions, art
  projects, social gatherings, or interviewing climate change leaders on our
  podcast, we'll make it happen. 
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
